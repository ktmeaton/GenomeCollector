2	612766	PRJNA612766	raw sequence reads	Nanopore targeted sequencing (NTS) method combines the advantages of target amplification and long-read, real-time sequencing, it can be used to efficiently detect SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses simultaneously. NTS is thus suitable for contemporary COVID-19 diagnosis; moreover, it can be further extended for diagnosing other viruses or pathogens.	eSequencing		eWhole	eGenome	eMultispecies	Nanopore targeted sequencing for SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses						2020-03-16		2020-03-16		Wuhan University

9	607948	PRJNA607948	raw sequence reads	Recent studies of SARS-CoV-2 have sequenced clinical samples or primary passaged samples in real time but have yet to look at low level viral diversity. It is critical to evaluate viral diversity below the consensus level as minor variants may impact patterns of virulence and person-to-person transmission efficiency. Additionally, the relative frequencies and functional impact (at the amino acid level) of this variation can be leveraged to make inferences about viral population dynamics and the relative roles of selection and random genetic fluctuations, or genetic drift.</p><p>To characterize within-host viral diversity of this emerging virus, we obtained for SARS-CoV-2/2019-nCoV/USA-WI-1/2020 samples from Yoshihiro Kawaoka's lab:</p><p>1.

16	231221	PRJNA231221	Genome sequencing and assembly	In May 2014, the FDA and collaborators established a publicly available dAtabase for Reference Grade micrObial Sequences called FDA-ARGOS. With funding support from FDAâ€™s Office of Counterterrorism and Emerging Threats (OCET) and DoD, the FDA-ARGOS team are initially collecting and sequencing 2000 microbes that include biothreat microorganisms, common clinical pathogens and closely related species. Currently, FDA-ARGOS microbial genomes are generated in 3 phases. Generally: <ul> <li>Phase 1 entails collection of a previously identified microbe and nucleic acid extraction.</li> <li>Phase 2, the microbial nucleic acids are sequenced and de novo assembled using Illumina and PacBio sequencing platforms at the Institute for Genome Sciences at the University of Maryland (UMD-IGS).</li> <li>Phase 3, the assembled genomes are vetted by an ID-NGS subject matter expert working group consisting of FDA personnel and collaborators and the data are deposited in NCBI databases.</li> </ul> <p> The FDA-ARGOS genomes meet the quality metrics for reference-grade genomes for regulatory use. FDA-ARGOS reference genomes have been de novo assembled with high depth of base coverage and placed within a pre-established phylogenetic tree. Each microbial isolate in the database is covered at a minimum of 20X over 95 percent of the assembled core genome. Furthermore, sample specific metadata, raw reads, assemblies, annotation and details of the bioinformatics pipeline are available.	eSequencing		eWhole	eGenome	eMultispecies	FDA-ARGOS is a database with public quality-controlled reference genomes for diagnostic use and regulatory science;Enhancement of Microbial Sequence Quality for Regulatory and Clinical Decision Processes Using High Throughput Sequencing Technologies						2013-12-11		2013-12-11	yes	US Food and Drug Administration;University of Maryland School of Medicine Institute for Genome Sciences (IGS) - sequencing center	eUnpublished		31346170	ePubmed
