Since the end of 2019, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been extensively epidemic in China, which not only seriously threatens the safety and health of Chinese people, but also challenges the management of other infectious diseases. Currently, there are still approximately three thousand malaria cases imported into China every year. If the diagnosis and treatment of malaria cases as well as the investigation and response of the epidemic foci are not carried out timely, it may endanger patients'lives and cause the possible of secondary transmission, which threatens the achievements of malaria elimination in China. Due to the extensive spread and high transmission ability of the COVID-19, there is a possibility of virus infections among malaria cases during the medical care-seeking behaviors and among healthcare professionals during clinical diagnosis and treatment, sample collection and testing and epidemiological surveys. This paper analyzes the challenges of the COVID-19 for Chinese malaria elimination programme, and proposes the countermeasures in response to the COVID-19 outbreak, so as to provide the reference for healthcare professionals.;b	32	1	7-9	10.16250/j.32.1374.2020036	Zhu;Cao	G D;J	Jiangsu Institute of Parasitic Diseases; WHO Collaborating Center for Research and Training on Malaria Elimination; Key Laboratory of National Health Commission on Parasitic Disease Control and Prevention; Jiangsu Provincial Key Laboratory on Parasite and Vector Control Technology, Wuxi 214064, China.;Jiangsu Institute of Parasitic Diseases; WHO Collaborating Center for Research and Training on Malaria Elimination; Key Laboratory of National Health Commission on Parasitic Disease Control and Prevention; Jiangsu Provincial Key Laboratory on Parasite and Vector Control Technology, Wuxi 214064, China.	chi		MEDLINE	ppublish

The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has been identified as the cause of an outbreak of respiratory illness in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China beginning in December 2019. As of 31 January 2020, this epidemic had spread to 19 countries with 11 791 confirmed cases, including 213 deaths. The World Health Organization has declared it a Public Health Emergency of International Concern.;A scoping review was conducted following the methodological framework suggested by Arksey and O'Malley. In this scoping review, 65 research articles published before 31 January 2020 were analyzed and discussed to better understand the epidemiology, causes, clinical diagnosis, prevention and control of this virus. The research domains, dates of publication, journal language, authors' affiliations, and methodological characteristics were included in the analysis. All the findings and statements in this review regarding the outbreak are based on published information as listed in the references.;Most of the publications were written using the English language (89.2%). The largest proportion of published articles were related to causes (38.5%) and a majority (67.7%) were published by Chinese scholars. Research articles initially focused on causes, but over time there was an increase of the articles related to prevention and control. Studies thus far have shown that the virus' origination is in connection to a seafood market in Wuhan, but specific animal associations have not been confirmed. Reported symptoms include fever, cough, fatigue, pneumonia, headache, diarrhea, hemoptysis, and dyspnea. Preventive measures such as masks, hand hygiene practices, avoidance of public contact, case detection, contact tracing, and quarantines have been discussed as ways to reduce transmission. To date, no specific antiviral treatment has proven effective; hence, infected people primarily rely on symptomatic treatment and supportive care.;There has been a rapid surge in research in response to the outbreak of COVID-19. During this early period, published research primarily explored the epidemiology, causes, clinical manifestation and diagnosis, as well as prevention and control of the novel coronavirus. Although these studies are relevant to control the current public emergency, more high-quality research is needed to provide valid and reliable ways to manage this kind of public health emergency in both the short- and long-term.	9	1	29	10.1186/s40249-020-00646-x	Adhikari;Meng;Wu;Mao;Ye;Wang;Sun;Sylvia;Rozelle;Raat;Zhou	Sasmita Poudel;Sha;Yu-Ju;Yu-Ping;Rui-Xue;Qing-Zhi;Chang;Sean;Scott;Hein;Huan	West China School of Public Health and West China Fourth Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.;West China School of Public Health and West China Fourth Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.;West China School of Public Health and West China Fourth Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.;Department of Communication Studies, California State University, Long Beach, CA, 90802, USA.;West China School of Public Health and West China Fourth Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.;West China School of Public Health and West China Fourth Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.;West China School of Public Health and West China Fourth Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.;Health Policy and Management, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, USA.;Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.;Department of Public Health, Erasmus MC-University Medical Center Rotterdam, 3000, CA, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.;West China School of Public Health and West China Fourth Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China. zhouhuan@scu.edu.cn.	eng		MEDLINE	epublish

The recent outbreak of pneumonia-causing COVID-19 in China is an urgent global public health issue with an increase in mortality and morbidity. Here we report our modelled homo-trimer structure of COVID-19 spike glycoprotein in both closed (ligand-free) and open (ligand-bound) conformation, which is involved in host cell adhesion. We also predict the unique N- and O-linked glycosylation sites of spike glycoprotein that distinguish it from the SARS and underlines shielding and camouflage of COVID-19 from the host the defence system. Furthermore, our study also highlights the key finding that the S1 domain of COVID-19 spike glycoprotein potentially interacts with the human CD26, a key immunoregulatory factor for hijacking and virulence. These findings accentuate the unique features of COVID-19 and assist in the development of new therapeutics.	9	1	601-604	10.1080/22221751.2020.1739565	Vankadari;Wilce	Naveen;Jacqueline A	Monash Biomedicine Discovery Institute and Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Monash University, Clayton, Australia.;Monash Biomedicine Discovery Institute and Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Monash University, Clayton, Australia.	eng		MEDLINE	ppublish

Unexplained pneumonia (UP) caused by a novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) emerged in China in late December 2019 and has infected more than 9000 cases by 31 January 2020. Shanghai reported the first imported case of COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease 2019) in 20 January 2020. A combinative approach of real-time RT-PCR, CRISPR-based assay and metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) were used to diagnose this unexplained pneumonia patient. Real-time RT-PCR and CRISPR-based assay both reported positive. This sample belonged to Betacoronavirus and shared a more than 99% nucleotide (nt) identity with the Wuhan SARS-CoV-2 isolates. We further compared pros and cons of common molecular diagnostics in UP. In this study, we illustrated the importance of combining molecular diagnostics to rule out common pathogens and performed mNGS to obtain unbiased potential pathogen result for the diagnosis of UP.	9	1	597-600	10.1080/22221751.2020.1738905	Ai;Zhang;Zhang;Xu;Zhang	Jing-Wen;Yi;Hao-Cheng;Teng;Wen-Hong	Department of Infectious Diseases, National Clinical Research Center for Aging and Medicine, Huashan Hospital, State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering, School of Life Science, Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology (MOE/MOH) and Institutes of Biomedical Sciences, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, Shanghai, People's Republic of China.;Department of Infectious Diseases, National Clinical Research Center for Aging and Medicine, Huashan Hospital, State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering, School of Life Science, Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology (MOE/MOH) and Institutes of Biomedical Sciences, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, Shanghai, People's Republic of China.;Department of Infectious Diseases, National Clinical Research Center for Aging and Medicine, Huashan Hospital, State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering, School of Life Science, Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology (MOE/MOH) and Institutes of Biomedical Sciences, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, Shanghai, People's Republic of China.;Vision Medicals Co., Ltd, Guangzhou, People's Republic of China.;Department of Infectious Diseases, National Clinical Research Center for Aging and Medicine, Huashan Hospital, State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering, School of Life Science, Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology (MOE/MOH) and Institutes of Biomedical Sciences, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, Shanghai, People's Republic of China.	eng		MEDLINE	ppublish
5	32172672	2020	Dec			Print	Journal Article;Review	Emerging microbes & infections	Emerg Microbes Infect	2222-1751	A tug-of-war between severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and host antiviral defence: lessons from other pathogenic viruses.	World Health Organization has declared the ongoing outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. The virus was named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses. Human infection with SARS-CoV-2 leads to a wide range of clinical manifestations ranging from asymptomatic, mild, moderate to severe. The severe cases present with pneumonia, which can progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome. The outbreak provides an opportunity for real-time tracking of an animal coronavirus that has just crossed species barrier to infect humans. The outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection is largely determined by virus-host interaction. Here, we review the discovery, zoonotic origin, animal hosts, transmissibility and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 in relation to its interplay with host antiviral defense. A comparison with SARS-CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, community-acquired human coronaviruses and other pathogenic viruses including human immunodeficiency viruses is made. We summarize current understanding of the induction of a proinflammatory cytokine storm by other highly pathogenic human coronaviruses, their adaptation to humans and their usurpation of the cell death programmes. Important questions concerning the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and host antiviral defence, including asymptomatic and presymptomatic virus shedding, are also discussed.	9	1	558-570	10.1080/22221751.2020.1736644	Fung;Yuen;Ye;Chan;Jin	Sin-Yee;Kit-San;Zi-Wei;Chi-Ping;Dong-Yan	School of Biomedical Sciences, The University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam, Hong Kong.;School of Biomedical Sciences, The University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam, Hong Kong.;Department of Microbiology, The University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam, Hong Kong.;School of Biomedical Sciences, The University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam, Hong Kong.;School of Biomedical Sciences, The University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam, Hong Kong.	eng		MEDLINE	ppublish

An acute respiratory disease, caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2, previously known as 2019-nCoV), the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread throughout China and received worldwide attention. On 30 January 2020, World Health Organization (WHO) officially declared the COVID-19 epidemic as a public health emergency of international concern. The emergence of SARS-CoV-2, since the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2002 and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012, marked the third introduction of a highly pathogenic and large-scale epidemic coronavirus into the human population in the twenty-first century. As of 1 March 2020, a total of 87,137 confirmed cases globally, 79,968 confirmed in China and 7169 outside of China, with 2977 deaths (3.4%) had been reported by WHO. Meanwhile, several independent research groups have identified that SARS-CoV-2 belongs to β-coronavirus, with highly identical genome to bat coronavirus, pointing to bat as the natural host. The novel coronavirus uses the same receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as that for SARS-CoV, and mainly spreads through the respiratory tract. Importantly, increasingly evidence showed sustained human-to-human transmission, along with many exported cases across the globe. The clinical symptoms of COVID-19 patients include fever, cough, fatigue and a small population of patients appeared gastrointestinal infection symptoms. The elderly and people with underlying diseases are susceptible to infection and prone to serious outcomes, which may be associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and cytokine storm. Currently, there are few specific antiviral strategies, but several potent candidates of antivirals and repurposed drugs are under urgent investigation. In this review, we summarized the latest research progress of the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and clinical characteristics of COVID-19, and discussed the current treatment and scientific advancements to combat the epidemic novel coronavirus.	7	1	11	10.1186/s40779-020-00240-0	Guo;Cao;Hong;Tan;Chen;Jin;Tan;Wang;Yan	Yan-Rong;Qing-Dong;Zhong-Si;Yuan-Yang;Shou-Deng;Hong-Jun;Kai-Sen;De-Yun;Yan	Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Biomedical Imaging and Guangdong Provincial Engineering Research Center of Molecular Imaging, Zhuhai, 519000, Guangdong, China.;Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery, the Fifth Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-Sen University, Zhuhai, 519000, Guangdong, China.;Center of Infectious Disease, the Fifth Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-Sen University, Zhuhai, 519000, Guangdong, China.;Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Biomedical Imaging and Guangdong Provincial Engineering Research Center of Molecular Imaging, Zhuhai, 519000, Guangdong, China.;Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Biomedical Imaging and Guangdong Provincial Engineering Research Center of Molecular Imaging, Zhuhai, 519000, Guangdong, China.;Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Biomedical Imaging and Guangdong Provincial Engineering Research Center of Molecular Imaging, Zhuhai, 519000, Guangdong, China.;Department of Otolaryngology, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, National University Health System, Singapore, 119228, Singapore.;Department of Otolaryngology, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, National University Health System, Singapore, 119228, Singapore. entwdy@nus.edu.sg.;Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Biomedical Imaging and Guangdong Provincial Engineering Research Center of Molecular Imaging, Zhuhai, 519000, Guangdong, China. yanyan35@mail.sysu.edu.cn.;Center for Interventional Medicine, the Fifth Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-Sen University, Zhuhai, 519000, Guangdong, China. yanyan35@mail.sysu.edu.cn.	eng	Am J Health Syst Pharm. 2015 Jan 15;72(2):112-6;JAMA. 2005 Nov 9;294(18):2291;N Engl J Med. 2003 May 15;348(20):1995-2005;J Pathol. 2004 Jun;203(2):631-7;Immunol Rev. 2009 Jan;227(1):75-86;Antiviral Res. 2013 Nov;100(2):446-54;Science. 2013 Feb 15;339(6121):826-30;J Virol. 2005 May;79(9):5288-95;Antiviral Res. 2014 Oct;110:94-103;Curr Pharm Des. 2007;13(34):3531-42;Science. 2005 Oct 28;310(5748):676-9;Annu Rev Pharmacol Toxicol. 2017 Jan 6;57:329-348;Antiviral Res. 2015 Feb;114:1-10;Tohoku J Exp Med. 2015;237(1):45-50;Curr Top Microbiol Immunol. 2018;419:1-42;Profiles Drug Subst Excip Relat Methodol. 2018;43:1-208;N Engl J Med. 2003 May 15;348(20):1986-94;Respirology. 2003 Nov;8 Suppl:S25-30;Nat Rev Drug Discov. 2016 May;15(5):327-47;BMC Infect Dis. 2016 Oct 3;16(1):534;Cell. 2005 Sep 9;122(5):669-82;Curr Opin Microbiol. 2014 Aug;20:131-8;N Engl J Med. 2013 Jun 13;368(24):2277-85;Adv Exp Med Biol. 2018;1045:103-122;Annu Rev Immunol. 2014;32:461-88;Respirology. 2018 Feb;23(2):130-137;Thorax. 2004 Mar;59(3):252-6;Neurosurg Focus. 2015 Mar;38(3):E12;Virus Res. 2015 Apr 16;202:120-34;J Korean Med Sci. 2017 May;32(5):744-749;Nat Immunol. 2010 May;11(5):373-84;J Virol. 2005 Dec;79(23):14614-21;Nature. 2001 Oct 18;413(6857):732-8;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2005 Aug 16;102(33):11876-81;Lancet Infect Dis. 2013 Sep;13(9):752-61;mBio. 2018 Mar 6;9(2):;J Infect Public Health. 2016 May-Jun;9(3):227-30;Drugs. 2003;63(8):769-802;Virol J. 2005 Aug 22;2:69;Expert Rev Vaccines. 2014 Jun;13(6):761-74;BMC Med. 2015 Sep 03;13:210;Sci Rep. 2015 Jan 15;5:7630;Nat Rev Microbiol. 2016 Aug;14(8):523-34;Curr Top Microbiol Immunol. 2005;287:31-55;BMJ. 2014 Apr 09;348:g2545;Nature. 2008 Oct 2;455(7213):674-8;Lancet Infect Dis. 2003 Nov;3(11):722-7	MEDLINE	epublish

A new coronavirus, referred to as SARS-CoV-2, is responsible for the recent outbreak of severe respiratory disease. This outbreak first detected in Wuhan, China in December 2019, has spread to other regions of China and to 25 other countries as of January, 2020. It has been known since the 2003 SARS epidemic that the receptor critical for SARS-CoV entry into host cells is the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The S1 domain of the spike protein of SARS-CoV attaches the virus to its cellular receptor ACE2 on the host cells. We thought that it is timely to explain the connection between the SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, ACE2 and the rationale for soluble ACE2 as a potential therapy.	134	5	543-545	10.1042/CS20200163	Batlle;Wysocki;Satchell	Daniel;Jan;Karla	Department of Medicine/ Division of Nephrology/Hypertension, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL, U.S.A.;Department of Medicine/ Division of Nephrology/Hypertension, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL, U.S.A.;Department Microbiology-Immunology, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL, U.S.A.;Center for Structural Genomics of Infectious Diseases, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL, U.S.A.	eng		MEDLINE	ppublish

In December 2019, a new virus (initially called 'Novel Coronavirus 2019-nCoV' and later renamed to SARS-CoV-2) causing severe acute respiratory syndrome (coronavirus disease COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, and rapidly spread to other parts of China and other countries around the world, despite China's massive efforts to contain the disease within Hubei. As with the original SARS-CoV epidemic of 2002/2003 and with seasonal influenza, geographic information systems and methods, including, among other application possibilities, online real-or near-real-time mapping of disease cases and of social media reactions to disease spread, predictive risk mapping using population travel data, and tracing and mapping super-spreader trajectories and contacts across space and time, are proving indispensable for timely and effective epidemic monitoring and response. This paper offers pointers to, and describes, a range of practical online/mobile GIS and mapping dashboards and applications for tracking the 2019/2020 coronavirus epidemic and associated events as they unfold around the world. Some of these dashboards and applications are receiving data updates in near-real-time (at the time of writing), and one of them is meant for individual users (in China) to check if the app user has had any close contact with a person confirmed or suspected to have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 in the recent past. We also discuss additional ways GIS can support the fight against infectious disease outbreaks and epidemics.	19	1	8	10.1186/s12942-020-00202-8	Kamel Boulos;Geraghty	Maged N;Estella M	School of Information Management, Sun Yat-sen University, East Campus, Guangzhou, 510006, Guangdong, China. mnkboulos@mail.sysu.edu.cn.;Esri (Environmental Systems Research Institute), 380 New York St, Redlands, CA, 92373, USA.	eng	Public Health Rep. 2016 May-Jun;131(3):461-73;Emerg Infect Dis. 2013 Jun;19(6):864-9;Yearb Med Inform. 2014 Aug 15;9:110-24;Stud Health Technol Inform. 2016;226:213-6;Int J Health Geogr. 2004 Jan 28;3(1):2	MEDLINE	epublish

Two months after the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the possibility of established and widespread community transmission in the European Union and European Economic Area (EU/EEA) is becoming more likely. We provide scenarios for use in preparedness for a possible widespread epidemic. The EU/EEA is moving towards the 'limited sustained transmission' phase. We propose actions to prepare for potential mitigation phases and coordinate efforts to protect the health of citizens.	25	9		10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2020.25.9.2000202	Johnson;Gossner;Colzani;Kinsman;Alexakis;Beauté;Würz;Tsolova;Bundle;Ekdahl	Helen C;Céline M;Edoardo;John;Leonidas;Julien;Andrea;Svetla;Nick;Karl	These authors contributed equally.;European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, Solna, Sweden.;These authors contributed equally.;European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, Solna, Sweden.;European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, Solna, Sweden.;European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, Solna, Sweden.;European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, Solna, Sweden.;European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, Solna, Sweden.;European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, Solna, Sweden.;European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, Solna, Sweden.;European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, Solna, Sweden.;European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, Solna, Sweden.	eng		MEDLINE	ppublish

The need for timely establishment of diagnostic assays arose when Germany was confronted with the first travel-associated outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Europe. We describe our laboratory experiences during a large contact tracing investigation, comparing previously published real-time RT-PCR assays in different PCR systems and a commercial kit. We found that assay performance using the same primers and probes with different PCR systems varied and the commercial kit performed well.	25	9		10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2020.25.9.2000173	Konrad;Eberle;Dangel;Treis;Berger;Bengs;Fingerle;Liebl;Ackermann;Sing	Regina;Ute;Alexandra;Bianca;Anja;Katja;Volker;Bernhard;Nikolaus;Andreas	These authors contributed equally to this work.;Public Health Microbiology Unit, Bavarian Health and Food Safety Authority, Oberschleißheim, Germany.;Unit of Virology, Bavarian Health and Food Safety Authority, Oberschleißheim, Germany.;These authors contributed equally to this work.;These authors contributed equally to this work.;Public Health Microbiology Unit, Bavarian Health and Food Safety Authority, Oberschleißheim, Germany.;Unit of Virology, Bavarian Health and Food Safety Authority, Oberschleißheim, Germany.;Public Health Microbiology Unit, Bavarian Health and Food Safety Authority, Oberschleißheim, Germany.;Public Health Microbiology Unit, Bavarian Health and Food Safety Authority, Oberschleißheim, Germany.;Unit of Virology, Bavarian Health and Food Safety Authority, Oberschleißheim, Germany.;Ludwig Maximilians-Universität, Munich, Germany.;State Institute of Health, Bavarian Health and Food Safety Authority, Oberschleißheim, Germany.;Unit of Virology, Bavarian Health and Food Safety Authority, Oberschleißheim, Germany.;These authors contributed equally to this work.;Ludwig Maximilians-Universität, Munich, Germany.;These authors contributed equally to this work.;Public Health Microbiology Unit, Bavarian Health and Food Safety Authority, Oberschleißheim, Germany.	eng	J Virol Methods. 2006 Mar;132(1-2):166-73	MEDLINE	ppublish

Facing the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), high-volume respiratory testing is demanded in laboratories worldwide. We evaluated the performance of a molecular assay for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 on a high-throughput platform, the cobas 6800, using the 'open channel' for integration of a laboratory-developed assay. We observed good analytical performance in clinical specimens. The fully automated workflow enables high-throughput testing with minimal hands-on time, while offering fast and reliable results.	25	9		10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2020.25.9.2000152	Pfefferle;Reucher;Nörz;Lütgehetmann	Susanne;Svenja;Dominic;Marc	Institute of Medical Microbiology, Virology and Hygiene, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE), Hamburg, Germany.;Institute of Medical Microbiology, Virology and Hygiene, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE), Hamburg, Germany.;Institute of Medical Microbiology, Virology and Hygiene, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE), Hamburg, Germany.;Institute of Medical Microbiology, Virology and Hygiene, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE), Hamburg, Germany.	eng	Future Microbiol. 2016;11(3):403-25;Science. 2013 Mar 15;339(6125):1264-8;J Clin Microbiol. 2017 Apr;55(4):1131-1139;J Clin Virol. 2018 May;102:63-69;Eur J Microbiol Immunol (Bp). 2017 Sep 11;7(3):176-186;Transfusion. 2018 Mar;58(3):641-648;Expert Rev Mol Diagn. 2017 Feb;17(2):167-180	MEDLINE	ppublish

Previous studies on the pneumonia outbreak caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) were based on information from the general population. Limited data are available for pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia. This study aimed to evaluate the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in pregnancy and the intrauterine vertical transmission potential of COVID-19 infection.;Clinical records, laboratory results, and chest CT scans were retrospectively reviewed for nine pregnant women with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia (ie, with maternal throat swab samples that were positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2]) who were admitted to Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China, from Jan 20 to Jan 31, 2020. Evidence of intrauterine vertical transmission was assessed by testing for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in amniotic fluid, cord blood, and neonatal throat swab samples. Breastmilk samples were also collected and tested from patients after the first lactation.;All nine patients had a caesarean section in their third trimester. Seven patients presented with a fever. Other symptoms, including cough (in four of nine patients), myalgia (in three), sore throat (in two), and malaise (in two), were also observed. Fetal distress was monitored in two cases. Five of nine patients had lymphopenia (<1·0 × 10⁹ cells per L). Three patients had increased aminotransferase concentrations. None of the patients developed severe COVID-19 pneumonia or died, as of Feb 4, 2020. Nine livebirths were recorded. No neonatal asphyxia was observed in newborn babies. All nine livebirths had a 1-min Apgar score of 8-9 and a 5-min Apgar score of 9-10. Amniotic fluid, cord blood, neonatal throat swab, and breastmilk samples from six patients were tested for SARS-CoV-2, and all samples tested negative for the virus.;The clinical characteristics of COVID-19 pneumonia in pregnant women were similar to those reported for non-pregnant adult patients who developed COVID-19 pneumonia. Findings from this small group of cases suggest that there is currently no evidence for intrauterine infection caused by vertical transmission in women who develop COVID-19 pneumonia in late pregnancy.;Hubei Science and Technology Plan, Wuhan University Medical Development Plan.	395	10226	809-815	10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30360-3	Chen;Guo;Wang;Luo;Yu;Zhang;Li;Zhao;Xu;Gong;Liao;Yang;Hou;Zhang	Huijun;Juanjuan;Chen;Fan;Xuechen;Wei;Jiafu;Dongchi;Dan;Qing;Jing;Huixia;Wei;Yuanzhen	Department of Gynaecology and Obstetrics, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, China; Clinical Medicine Research Centre of Prenatal Diagnosis and Birth Health in Hubei Province, Wuhan, Hubei, China.;Department of Gynaecology and Obstetrics, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, China; Clinical Medicine Research Centre of Prenatal Diagnosis and Birth Health in Hubei Province, Wuhan, Hubei, China.;Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Peking University First Hospital, Beijing, China.;State Key Laboratory of Virology/Institute of Medical Virology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, China.;Department of Gynaecology and Obstetrics, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, China; Clinical Medicine Research Centre of Prenatal Diagnosis and Birth Health in Hubei Province, Wuhan, Hubei, China.;Department of Preventive Medicine, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL, USA.;Department of Gynaecology and Obstetrics, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, China; Clinical Medicine Research Centre of Prenatal Diagnosis and Birth Health in Hubei Province, Wuhan, Hubei, China.;Department of Paediatrics, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, China.;Department of Gynaecology and Obstetrics, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, China; Clinical Medicine Research Centre of Prenatal Diagnosis and Birth Health in Hubei Province, Wuhan, Hubei, China.;Department of Gynaecology and Obstetrics, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, China; Clinical Medicine Research Centre of Prenatal Diagnosis and Birth Health in Hubei Province, Wuhan, Hubei, China.;Department of Gynaecology and Obstetrics, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, China; Clinical Medicine Research Centre of Prenatal Diagnosis and Birth Health in Hubei Province, Wuhan, Hubei, China.;Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Peking University First Hospital, Beijing, China.

As of 28 February 2020, Italy had 888 cases of SARS-CoV-2 infections, with most cases in Northern Italy in the Lombardia and Veneto regions. Travel-related cases were the main source of COVID-19 cases during the early stages of the current epidemic in Italy. The month of February, however, has been dominated by two large clusters of outbreaks in Northern Italy, south of Milan, with mainly local transmission the source of infections. Contact tracing has failed to identify patient zero in one of the outbreaks. As of 28 February 2020, twenty-one cases of COVID-19 have died. Comparison between case fatality rates in China and Italy are identical at 2.3. Additionally, deaths are similar in both countries with fatalities in mostly the elderly with known comorbidities. It will be important to develop point-of-care devices to aid clinicians in stratifying elderly patients as early as possible to determine the potential level of care they will require to improve their chances of survival from COVID-19 disease.	14	2	125-128	10.3855/jidc.12600	Porcheddu;Serra;Kelvin;Kelvin;Rubino	Rossella;Caterina;David;Nikki;Salvatore	Freelance Journalist, JIDC Italy. rporcheddu@jidc.org.;Dipartimento di Scienze Biomediche, Università degli Studi di Sassari, Sassari, Italy. cserra@uniss.it.;JIDC-Canada; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Canadian Center for Vaccinology, Dalhousie University, Halifax, NS, Canada.

After the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak, we estimated the distribution and scale of more than 5 million migrants residing in Wuhan after they returned to their hometown communities in Hubei Province or other provinces at the end of 2019 by using the data from the 2013-2018 China Migrants Dynamic Survey (CMDS). We found that the distribution of Wuhan's migrants is centred in Hubei Province (approximately 75%) at a provincial level, gradually decreasing in the surrounding provinces in layers, with obvious spatial characteristics of circle layers and echelons. The scale of Wuhan's migrants, whose origins in Hubei Province give rise to a gradient reduction from east to west within the province, and account for 66% of Wuhan's total migrants, are from the surrounding prefectural-level cities of Wuhan. The distribution comprises 94 districts and counties in Hubei Province, and the cumulative percentage of the top 30 districts and counties exceeds 80%. Wuhan's migrants have a large proportion of middle-aged and high-risk individuals. Their social characteristics include nuclear family migration (84%), migration with families of 3-4 members (71%), a rural household registration (85%), and working or doing business (84%) as the main reason for migration. Using a quasi-experimental analysis framework, we found that the size of Wuhan's migrants was highly correlated with the daily number of confirmed cases. Furthermore, we compared the epidemic situation in different regions and found that the number of confirmed cases in some provinces and cities in Hubei Province may be underestimated, while the epidemic situation in some regions has increased rapidly. The results are conducive to monitoring the epidemic prevention and control in various regions.	17	5		10.3390/ijerph17051679	Fan;Liu;Guo;Yang;Ye;Jilili;Ren;Xu;Long;Wang	Changyu;Linping;Wei;Anuo;Chenchen;Maitixirepu;Meina;Peng;Hexing;Yufan	School of Sociology, Central China Normal University, Wuhan 430079, Hubei Province, China.;School of Public Administration, Hangzhou Normal University, Hangzhou 311121, Zhejiang Province, China.;School of Social and Behavioral Sciences, Nanjing University, Nanjing 210046, Jiangsu Province, China.;School of Social and Behavioral Sciences, Nanjing University, Nanjing 210046, Jiangsu Province, China.;School of Social and Behavioral Sciences, Nanjing University, Nanjing 210046, Jiangsu Province, China.;School of Social and Behavioral Sciences, Nanjing University, Nanjing 210046, Jiangsu Province, China.;School of Social and Behavioral Sciences, Nanjing University, Nanjing 210046, Jiangsu Province, China.;School of Social and Behavioral Sciences, Nanjing University, Nanjing 210046, Jiangsu Province, China.;School of Sociology, Wuhan University, Wuhan 430072, Hubei Province, China.;School of Economics, Minzu University of China, Beijing 100081, China.;School of Sociology, Central China Normal University, Wuhan 430079, Hubei Province, China.	eng		MEDLINE	epublish

On 31 December 2019, a cluster of acute respiratory illness was reported from China and later confirmed as novel coronavirus on 7 January 2020. This virus is the same member of the coronavirus family that caused the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) reported in China 2003, and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) reported in Saudi Arabia in 2012. The initial cases have been linked to a live seafood market in Wuhan, China, and the specific animal source is yet to be determined. The detection of this new virus in humans without knowing the source of the infection has raised greatly heightened concerns not only in China, but also internationally. To date, the outbreak has spread to most provinces in China and 25 other countries within a relatively short period. Consequent to its spread, Dr Tedros Ghebreyesus, Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO), declared the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) on 30 January 2020.	26	2	136-137	10.26719/2020.26.2.136	Al-Mandhari;Samhouri;Abubakar;Brennan	Ahmed;Dalia;Abdinasir;Richard	Regional Director, World Health Organization Regional Office for the Eastern Mediterranean, Cairo, Egypt.;Programme Area Manager, Emergency Preparedness and International Health Regulations, World Health Organization Regional Office for the Eastern Mediterranean, Cairo, Egypt.;Acting Programme Area Manager, Infectious Hazard Preparedness Unit, World Health Organization Regional Office for the Eastern Mediterranean, Cairo, Egypt.;Regional Emergency Director, World Health Organization Regional Office for the Eastern Mediterranean, Cairo, Egypt.	eng		MEDLINE	epublish

Human infections with zoonotic coronavirus contain emerging and reemerging pathogenic characteristics which have raised great public health concern. This study aimed at investigating the global prevalence, biological and clinical characteristics of novel coronavirus, Wuhan China (2019-nCoV), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection outbreaks.;The data on the global outbreak of "2019-nCoV, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV" were obtained from World Health Organization (WHO), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), concerned ministries and research institutes. We also recorded the information from research documents published in global scientific journals indexed in ISI Web of Science and research centers on the prevalence, biological and clinical characteristics of 2019-nCoV, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV.;Worldwide, SARS-CoV involved 32 countries, with 8422 confirmed cases and 916 (10.87%) casualties from November 2002 to August 2003. MERS-CoV spread over 27 states, causing 2496 cases and 868 (34.77%) fatalities during the period April 2012 to December 2019. However, the novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV spread swiftly the global borders of 27 countries. It infected 34799 people and resulted in 724 (2.08%) casualties during the period December 29, 2019 to February 7, 2020. The fatality rate of coronavirus MERS-CoV was (34.77%) higher than SARS-CoV (10.87%) and 2019-nCoV (2.08%); however, the 2019-nCoV transmitted rapidly in comparison to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.;The novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV has diverse epidemiological and biological characteristics, making it more contagious than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. It has affected more people in a short time period compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, although the fatality rate of MERS-CoV was higher than SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV. The major clinical manifestations in coronavirus infections 2019-nCoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS CoV are fever, chills, cough, shortness of breath, generalized myalgia, malaise, drowsy, diarrhea, confusion, dyspnea, and pneumonia. Global health authorities should take immediate measures to prevent the outbreaks of such emerging and reemerging pathogens across the globe to minimize the disease burden locally and globally.	24	4	2012-2019	10.26355/eurrev_202002_20379	Meo;Alhowikan;Al-Khlaiwi;Meo;Halepoto;Iqbal;Usmani;Hajjar;Ahmed	S A;A M;T;I M;D M;M;A M;W;N	Department of Physiology, Strategic Centre for Diabetes Research, Thoracic Surgery, College of Medicine, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. sultanmeo@hotmail.com.	eng		MEDLINE	ppublish

The World Health Organization (WHO) has issued a warning that, although the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) from Wuhan City (China), is not pandemic, it should be contained to prevent the global spread. The COVID-19 virus was known earlier as 2019-nCoV. As of 12 February 2020, WHO reported 45,171 cases and 1115 deaths related to COVID-19. COVID-19 is similar to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) virus in its pathogenicity, clinical spectrum, and epidemiology. Comparison of the genome sequences of COVID-19, SARS-CoV, and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) showed that COVID-19 has a better sequence identity with SARS-CoV compared to MERS CoV. However, the amino acid sequence of COVID-19 differs from other coronaviruses specifically in the regions of 1ab polyprotein and surface glycoprotein or S-protein. Although several animals have been speculated to be a reservoir for COVID-19, no animal reservoir has been already confirmed. COVID-19 causes COVID-19 disease that has similar symptoms as SARS-CoV. Studies suggest that the human receptor for COVID-19 may be angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor similar to that of SARS-CoV. The nucleocapsid (N) protein of COVID-19 has nearly 90% amino acid sequence identity with SARS-CoV. The N protein antibodies of SARS-CoV may cross react with COVID-19 but may not provide cross-immunity. In a similar fashion to SARS-CoV, the N protein of COVID-19 may play an important role in suppressing the RNA interference (RNAi) to overcome the host defense. This mini-review aims at investigating the most recent trend of COVID-19.	24	4	2006-2011	10.26355/eurrev_202002_20378	Kannan;Shaik Syed Ali;Sheeza;Hemalatha	S;P;A;K	School of Medicine, The Maldives National University, Male', Maldives.

39	32138488	2020	Mar			Print	Journal Article	The Journal of the Association of Physicians of India	J Assoc Physicians India	0004-5772	The 2019 Novel Coronavirus Outbreak - A Global Threat.	The 2019 Novel Corona virus infection (COVID 19) is an ongoing public health emergency of international significance. There are significant knowledge gaps in the epidemiology, transmission dynamics, investigation tools and management. In this article, we review the available evidence about this disease. Every decade has witnessed the evolution of a new coronavirus epidemic since the last three decades. The varying transmission patterns, namely, nosocomial transmission and spread through mildly symptomatic cases is an area of concern. There is a spectrum of clinical features from mild to severe life threatening disease with major complications like severe pneumonia, ARDS, acute cardiac injury and septic shock. Presence of bilateral ground glass opacity and consolidation on imaging in appropriate clinical background should raise a suspicion about COVID 19. Poor prognostic factors include Multilobular infiltration on chest imaging, Lymphopenia, Bacterial co-infection, Smoking history, Chronic medical conditions like Hypertension and age >60 years (MuLBSTA score). Diagnosis is confirmed with PCR based testing of appropriate respiratory samples. Management is primarily supportive, with newer antivirals (lopinavir ritonavir and Remdesivir) under investigation. Role of steroids is still inconclusive. Standard infection control and prevention techniques should be followed. Vigilant screening of suspected cases and their contacts is important. Isolation of symptomatic cases and home quarantine of asymptomatic contacts is recommended. To conclude, controlling this highly transmissible disease requires international co-ordination.	68	3	67-71		Khot;Nadkar	Wasim Yunus;Milind Y	Assistant Professor.;Professor and Head, Department of Medicine, Seth GS Medical College and KEM Hospital, Mumbai, Maharashtra.	eng		MEDLINE	ppublish

In late December 2019, a previous unidentified coronavirus, currently named as the 2019 novel coronavirus#, emerged from Wuhan, China, and resulted in a formidable outbreak in many cities in China and expanded globally, including Thailand, Republic of Korea, Japan, United States, Philippines, Viet Nam, and our country (as of 2/6/2020 at least 25 countries). The disease is officially named as Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19, by WHO on February 11, 2020). It is also named as Severe Pneumonia with Novel Pathogens on January 15, 2019 by the Taiwan CDC, the Ministry of Health and is a notifiable communicable disease of the fifth category. COVID-19 is a potential zoonotic disease with low to moderate (estimated 2%-5%) mortality rate. Person-to-person transmission may occur through droplet or contact transmission and if there is a lack of stringent infection control or if no proper personal protective equipment available, it may jeopardize the first-line healthcare workers. Currently, there is no definite treatment for COVID-19 although some drugs are under investigation. To promptly identify patients and prevent further spreading, physicians should be aware of the travel or contact history of the patient with compatible symptoms.	83	3	217-220	10.1097/JCMA.0000000000000270	Wu;Chen;Chan	Yi-Chi;Ching-Sung;Yu-Jiun	Division of Microbiology, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC.;Division of Microbiology, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC.;Division of Microbiology, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC.;Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC.;Institute of Public Health, School of Medicine, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC.	eng		MEDLINE	ppublish

Monit.	1643-3750	The Effects of Social Support on Sleep Quality of Medical Staff Treating Patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in January and February 2020 in China.	BACKGROUND Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), formerly known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan City, China. Structural equation modeling (SEM) is a multivariate analysis method to determine the structural relationship between measured variables. This observational study aimed to use SEM to determine the effects of social support on sleep quality and function of medical staff who treated patients with COVID-19 in January and February 2020 in Wuhan, China. MATERIAL AND METHODS A one-month cross-sectional observational study included 180 medical staff who treated patients with COVID-19 infection. Levels of anxiety, self-efficacy, stress, sleep quality, and social support were measured using the and the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), the General Self-Efficacy Scale (GSES), the Stanford Acute Stress Reaction (SASR) questionnaire, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and the Social Support Rate Scale (SSRS), respectively. Pearson's correlation analysis and SEM identified the interactions between these factors. RESULTS Levels of social support for medical staff were significantly associated with self-efficacy and sleep quality and negatively associated with the degree of anxiety and stress. Levels of anxiety were significantly associated with the levels of stress, which negatively impacted self-efficacy and sleep quality. Anxiety, stress, and self-efficacy were mediating variables associated with social support and sleep quality. CONCLUSIONS SEM showed that medical staff in China who were treating patients with COVID-19 infection during January and February 2020 had levels of anxiety, stress, and self-efficacy that were dependent on sleep quality and social support.	26		e923549	10.12659/MSM.923549	Xiao;Zhang;Kong;Li;Yang	Han;Yan;Desheng;Shiyue;Ningxi	Department of Respiration, Xuanwu Hospital Capital Medical University, Beijing, China (mainland).;College of Humanities and Social Sciences, Harbin Engineering University, Harbin, Heilongjiang, China (mainland).;College of Humanities and Social Sciences, Harbin Engineering University, Harbin, Heilongjiang, China (mainland).;School of Health Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, China (mainland).;College of Humanities and Social Sciences, Harbin Engineering University, Harbin, Heilongjiang, China (mainland).	eng		MEDLINE	epublish

A novel β-coronavirus (2019-nCoV) caused severe and even fetal pneumonia explored in a seafood market of Wuhan city, Hubei province, China, and rapidly spread to other provinces of China and other countries. The 2019-nCoV was different from SARS-CoV, but shared the same host receptor the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The natural host of 2019-nCoV may be the bat Rhinolophus affinis as 2019-nCoV showed 96.2% of whole-genome identity to BatCoV RaTG13. The person-to-person transmission routes of 2019-nCoV included direct transmission, such as cough, sneeze, droplet inhalation transmission, and contact transmission, such as the contact with oral, nasal, and eye mucous membranes. 2019-nCoV can also be transmitted through the saliva, and the fetal-oral routes may also be a potential person-to-person transmission route. The participants in dental practice expose to tremendous risk of 2019-nCoV infection due to the face-to-face communication and the exposure to saliva, blood, and other body fluids, and the handling of sharp instruments. Dental professionals play great roles in preventing the transmission of 2019-nCoV. Here we recommend the infection control measures during dental practice to block the person-to-person transmission routes in dental clinics and hospitals.	12	1	9	10.1038/s41368-020-0075-9	Peng;Xu;Li;Cheng;Zhou;Ren	Xian;Xin;Yuqing;Lei;Xuedong;Biao	State Key Laboratory of Oral Diseases & National Clinical Research Center for Oral Diseases & Department of Cariology and Endodontics, West China Hospital of Stomatology, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.;State Key Laboratory of Oral Diseases & National Clinical Research Center for Oral Diseases & Department of Cariology and Endodontics, West China Hospital of Stomatology, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.;State Key Laboratory of Oral Diseases & National Clinical Research Center for Oral Diseases & Department of Cariology and Endodontics, West China Hospital of Stomatology, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.;State Key Laboratory of Oral Diseases & National Clinical Research Center for Oral Diseases & Department of Cariology and Endodontics, West China Hospital of Stomatology, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.;State Key Laboratory of Oral Diseases & National Clinical Research Center for Oral Diseases & Department of Cariology and Endodontics, West China Hospital of Stomatology, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China. zhouxd@scu.edu.cn.;State Key Laboratory of Oral Diseases & National Clinical Research Center for Oral Diseases & Department of Cariology and Endodontics, West China Hospital of Stomatology, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China. renbiao@scu.edu.cn.	eng		MEDLINE	epublish

As reported by the World Health Organization, a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was identified as the causative virus of Wuhan pneumonia of unknown etiology by Chinese authorities on 7 January, 2020. The virus was named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses on 11 February, 2020. This study aimed to develop a mathematical model for calculating the transmissibility of the virus.;In this study, we developed a Bats-Hosts-Reservoir-People transmission network model for simulating the potential transmission from the infection source (probably be bats) to the human infection. Since the Bats-Hosts-Reservoir network was hard to explore clearly and public concerns were focusing on the transmission from Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market (reservoir) to people, we simplified the model as Reservoir-People (RP) transmission network model. The next generation matrix approach was adopted to calculate the basic reproduction number (R;The value of R;Our model showed that the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 was higher than the Middle East respiratory syndrome in the Middle East countries, similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome, but lower than MERS in the Republic of Korea.	9	1	24	10.1186/s40249-020-00640-3	Chen;Rui;Wang;Zhao;Cui;Yin	Tian-Mu;Jia;Qiu-Peng;Ze-Yu;Jing-An;Ling	State Key Laboratory of Molecular Vaccinology and Molecular Diagnostics, School of Public Health, Xiamen University, 4221-117 South Xiang'an Road, Xiang'an District, Xiamen, Fujian Province, People's Republic of China. 13698665@qq.com.;State Key Laboratory of Molecular Vaccinology and Molecular Diagnostics, School of Public Health, Xiamen University, 4221-117 South Xiang'an Road, Xiang'an District, Xiamen, Fujian Province, People's Republic of China.;State Key Laboratory of Molecular Vaccinology and Molecular Diagnostics, School of Public Health, Xiamen University, 4221-117 South Xiang'an Road, Xiang'an District, Xiamen, Fujian Province, People's Republic of China.;State Key Laboratory of Molecular Vaccinology and Molecular Diagnostics, School of Public Health, Xiamen University, 4221-117 South Xiang'an Road, Xiang'an District, Xiamen, Fujian Province, People's Republic of China.;Department of Mathematics, School of Science, Beijing University of Civil Engineering and Architecture, Beijing, People's Republic of China.;Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenzhen, Guangdong Province, People's Republic of China.	eng	Lancet. 2020 Feb 15;395(10223):514-523;PLoS One. 2015 Dec 21;10(12):e0144778;Lancet Infect Dis. 2014 Jan;14(1):50-56;Epidemiol Infect. 2017 Feb;145(3):424-433;Science. 2003 Jun 20;300(5627):1884-5;Nature. 2020 Feb 3;:;Lancet. 2020 Feb 29;395(10225):689-697;Lancet. 2020 Feb 15;395(10223):497-506;Emerg Infect Dis. 2003 Dec;9(12):1608-10;Science. 2003 Jun 20;300(5627):1961-6;Sci Rep. 2020 Jan 10;10(1):119;N Engl J Med. 2020 Feb 20;382(8):727-733;Int J Infect Dis. 2020 Jan 30;92:214-217;Lancet. 2013 Aug 24;382(9893):694-9;J Travel Med. 2020 Jan 14;:;PLoS One. 2014 Apr 15;9(4):e95006;Influenza Other Respir Viruses. 2017 Sep;11(5):434-444;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2017 Apr 11;114(15):4023-4028;PLoS Negl Trop Dis. 2019 Aug 15;13(8):e0007659;Public Health. 2019 Sep;174:42-48;N Engl J Med. 2020 Jan 29;:;J Clin Med. 2020 Feb 01;9(2):;Science. 2005 Aug 12;309(5737):1083-7;Travel Med Infect Dis. 2014 Nov-Dec;12(6 Pt A):650-8	MEDLINE	epublish

The beginning of 2020 has seen the emergence of COVID-19 outbreak caused by a novel coronavirus, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). There is an imminent need to better understand this new virus and to develop ways to control its spread. In this study, we sought to gain insights for vaccine design against SARS-CoV-2 by considering the high genetic similarity between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, which caused the outbreak in 2003, and leveraging existing immunological studies of SARS-CoV. By screening the experimentally-determined SARS-CoV-derived B cell and T cell epitopes in the immunogenic structural proteins of SARS-CoV, we identified a set of B cell and T cell epitopes derived from the spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins that map identically to SARS-CoV-2 proteins. As no mutation has been observed in these identified epitopes among the 120 available SARS-CoV-2 sequences (as of 21 February 2020), immune targeting of these epitopes may potentially offer protection against this novel virus. For the T cell epitopes, we performed a population coverage analysis of the associated MHC alleles and proposed a set of epitopes that is estimated to provide broad coverage globally, as well as in China. Our findings provide a screened set of epitopes that can help guide experimental efforts towards the development of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.	12	3		10.3390/v12030254	Ahmed;Quadeer;McKay	Syed Faraz;Ahmed A;Matthew R	Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China.;Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China.;Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China.;Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China.	eng		MEDLINE	epublish

Rep.	1545-861X	Update: Public Health Response to the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Outbreak - United States, February 24, 2020.	An outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) began in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China in December 2019, and has spread throughout China and to 31 other countries and territories, including the United States (1). As of February 23, 2020, there were 76,936 reported cases in mainland China and 1,875 cases in locations outside mainland China (1). There have been 2,462 associated deaths worldwide; no deaths have been reported in the United States. Fourteen cases have been diagnosed in the United States, and an additional 39 cases have occurred among repatriated persons from high-risk settings, for a current total of 53 cases within the United States. This report summarizes the aggressive measures (2,3) that CDC, state and local health departments, multiple other federal agencies, and other partners are implementing to slow and try to contain transmission of COVID-19 in the United States. These measures require the identification of cases and contacts of persons with COVID-19 in the United States and the recommended assessment, monitoring, and care of travelers arriving from areas with substantial COVID-19 transmission. Although these measures might not prevent widespread transmission of the virus in the United States, they are being implemented to 1) slow the spread of illness; 2) provide time to better prepare state and local health departments, health care systems, businesses, educational organizations, and the general public in the event that widespread transmission occurs; and 3) better characterize COVID-19 to guide public health recommendations and the development and deployment of medical countermeasures, including diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines. U.S. public health authorities are monitoring the situation closely, and CDC is coordinating efforts with the World Health Organization (WHO) and other global partners. Interim guidance is available at https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/index.html. As more is learned about this novel virus and this outbreak, CDC will rapidly incorporate new knowledge into guidance for action by CDC, state and local health departments, health care providers, and communities.	69	8	216-219	10.15585/mmwr.mm6908e1	Jernigan	Daniel B	CDC COVID-19 Response Team, CDC.	eng		MEDLINE	epublish

An ongoing outbreak of a novel coronavirus infection in Wuhan, China since December 2019 has led to 31,516 infected persons and 638 deaths across 25 countries (till 16:00 on February 7, 2020). The virus causing this pneumonia was then named as the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) by the World Health Organization. To promote the data sharing and make all relevant information of 2019-nCoV publicly available, we construct the 2019 Novel Coronavirus Resource (2019nCoVR, https://bigd.big.ac.cn/ncov). 2019nCoVR features comprehensive integration of genomic and proteomic sequences as well as their metadata information from the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data, National Center for Biotechnology Information, China National GeneBank, National Microbiology Data Center and China National Center for Bioinformation (CNCB)/National Genomics Data Center (NGDC). It also incorporates a wide range of relevant information including scientific literatures, news, and popular articles for science dissemination, and provides visualization functionalities for genome variation analysis results based on all collected 2019-nCoV strains. Moreover, by linking seamlessly with related databases in CNCB/NGDC, 2019nCoVR offers virus data submission and sharing services for raw sequence reads and assembled sequences. In this report, we provide comprehensive descriptions on data deposition, management, release and utility in 2019nCoVR, laying important foundations in aid of studies on virus classification and origin, genome variation and evolution, fast detection, drug development and pneumonia precision prevention and therapy.;2019年12月在中国武汉开始爆发的新型肺炎已造成全球25个国家/地区的31516人感染、638人死亡(截止2020年2月7日16时),引起该肺炎的病毒被世界卫生组织命名为2019新型冠状病毒(2019-nCoV)。为促进2019-nCoV数据共享应用并及时向全球公众提供病毒的相关信息,国家生物信息中心(CNCB)/国家基因组科学数据中心(NGDC)建立了2019新型冠状病毒信息库(2019nCoVR,https://bigd.big.ac.cn/ncov)。该信息库整合了来自德国全球流感病毒数据库、美国国家生物技术信息中心、深圳(国家)基因库、国家微生物科学数据中心及CNCB/NGDC等机构公开发布的2019-nCoV核苷酸和蛋白质序列数据、元信息、学术文献、新闻动态、科普文章等信息,开展了不同冠状病毒株的基因组序列变异分析并提供可视化展示。同时,2019nCoVR无缝对接CNCB/NGDC的相关数据库,提供新测序病毒株系的基因组原始测序数据、组装后序列的在线汇交、管理与共享、国际数据库同步发布等数据服务。本文对2019nCoVR数据汇交、管理、发布及使用等进行全面阐述,以方便用户了解该信息库各项功能及数据状况,为加速开展病毒的分类溯源、变异演化、快速检测、药物研发以及新型肺炎的精准预防与治疗等研究提供重要基础。.	42	2	212-221	10.16288/j.yczz.20-030	Zhao;Song;Chen;Zou;Ma;Ma;Li;Hao;Li;Tian;Tang;Wang;Zhu;Chen;Zhang;Xue;Bao	Wen-Ming;Shu-Hui;Mei-Li;Dong;Li-Na;Ying-Ke;Ru-Jiao;Li-Li;Cui-Ping;Dong-Mei;Bi-Xia;Yan-Qing;Jun-Wei;Huan-Xin;Zhang;Yong-Biao;Yi-Ming	China National Center for Bioinformation & National Genomics Data Center, Beijing Institute of Genomics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, China;

Infect.	1469-4409	Passengers' destinations from China: low risk of Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) transmission into Africa and South America.	Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV [SARS-COV-2]) was detected in humans during the last week of December 2019 at Wuhan city in China, and caused 24 554 cases in 27 countries and territories as of 5 February 2020. The objective of this study was to estimate the risk of transmission of 2019-nCoV through human passenger air flight from four major cities of China (Wuhan, Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou) to the passengers' destination countries. We extracted the weekly simulated passengers' end destination data for the period of 1-31 January 2020 from FLIRT, an online air travel dataset that uses information from 800 airlines to show the direct flight and passengers' end destination. We estimated a risk index of 2019-nCoV transmission based on the number of travellers to destination countries, weighted by the number of confirmed cases of the departed city reported by the World Health Organization (WHO). We ranked each country based on the risk index in four quantiles (4th quantile being the highest risk and 1st quantile being the lowest risk). During the period, 388 287 passengers were destined for 1297 airports in 168 countries or territories across the world. The risk index of 2019-nCoV among the countries had a very high correlation with the WHO-reported confirmed cases (0.97). According to our risk score classification, of the countries that reported at least one Coronavirus-infected pneumonia (COVID-19) case as of 5 February 2020, 24 countries were in the 4th quantile of the risk index, two in the 3rd quantile, one in the 2nd quantile and none in the 1st quantile. Outside China, countries with a higher risk of 2019-nCoV transmission are Thailand, Cambodia, Malaysia, Canada and the USA, all of which reported at least one case. In pan-Europe, UK, France, Russia, Germany and Italy; in North America, USA and Canada; in Oceania, Australia had high risk, all of them reported at least one case. In Africa and South America, the risk of transmission is very low with Ethiopia, South Africa, Egypt, Mauritius and Brazil showing a similar risk of transmission compared to the risk of any of the countries where at least one case is detected. The risk of transmission on 31 January 2020 was very high in neighbouring Asian countries, followed by Europe (UK, France, Russia and Germany), Oceania (Australia) and North America (USA and Canada). Increased public health response including early case recognition, isolation of identified case, contract tracing and targeted airport screening, public awareness and vigilance of health workers will help mitigate the force of further spread to naïve countries.	148		e41	10.1017/S0950268820000424	Haider;Yavlinsky;Simons;Osman;Ntoumi;Zumla;Kock	Najmul;Alexei;David;Abdinasir Yusuf;Francine;Alimuddin;Richard	The Royal Veterinary College, University of London, Hawkshead Lane, North Mymms, Hatfield, Hertfordshire.;Institute of Health Informatics, University College London, London, UK.;The Royal Veterinary College, University of London, Hawkshead Lane, North Mymms, Hatfield, Hertfordshire.;The Royal Veterinary College, University of London, Hawkshead Lane, North Mymms, Hatfield, Hertfordshire.;Fondation Congolaise pour la Recherche Médicale (FCRM), Brazzaville, Republic of Congo.;Institute for Tropical Medicine/University of Tübingen, Tubingen, Germany.;Department of Infection, Division of Infection and Immunity, UCL Centre for Clinical Microbiology, Royal Free campus, London, UK.;NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, UCL Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK.;The Royal Veterinary College, University of London, Hawkshead Lane, North Mymms, Hatfield, Hertfordshire.	eng	PLoS Curr. 2016 Jun 10;8:	MEDLINE	epublish

It has been reported that ACE2 is the main host cell receptor of 2019-nCoV and plays a crucial role in the entry of virus into the cell to cause the final infection. To investigate the potential route of 2019-nCov infection on the mucosa of oral cavity, bulk RNA-seq profiles from two public databases including The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Functional Annotation of The Mammalian Genome Cap Analysis of Gene Expression (FANTOM5 CAGE) dataset were collected. RNA-seq profiling data of 13 organ types with para-carcinoma normal tissues from TCGA and 14 organ types with normal tissues from FANTOM5 CAGE were analyzed in order to explore and validate the expression of ACE2 on the mucosa of oral cavity. Further, single-cell transcriptomes from an independent data generated in-house were used to identify and confirm the ACE2-expressing cell composition and proportion in oral cavity. The results demonstrated that the ACE2 expressed on the mucosa of oral cavity. Interestingly, this receptor was highly enriched in epithelial cells of tongue. Preliminarily, those findings have explained the basic mechanism that the oral cavity is a potentially high risk for 2019-nCoV infectious susceptibility and provided a piece of evidence for the future prevention strategy in dental clinical practice as well as daily life.	12	1	8	10.1038/s41368-020-0074-x	Xu;Zhong;Deng;Peng;Dan;Zeng;Li;Chen	Hao;Liang;Jiaxin;Jiakuan;Hongxia;Xin;Taiwen;Qianming	State Key Laboratory of Oral Diseases, National Clinical Research Center for Oral Diseases, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences Research Unit of Oral Carcinogenesis and Management, West China Hospital of Stomatology, Sichuan University, Chengdu, Sichuan, China.;State Key Laboratory of Oral Diseases, National Clinical Research Center for Oral Diseases, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences Research Unit of Oral Carcinogenesis and Management, West China Hospital of Stomatology, Sichuan University, Chengdu, Sichuan, China.;State Key Laboratory of Oral Diseases, National Clinical Research Center for Oral Diseases, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences Research Unit of Oral Carcinogenesis and Management, West China Hospital of Stomatology, Sichuan University, Chengdu, Sichuan, China.;State Key Laboratory of Oral Diseases, National Clinical Research Center for Oral Diseases, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences Research Unit of Oral Carcinogenesis and Management, West China Hospital of Stomatology, Sichuan University, Chengdu, Sichuan, China.;State Key Laboratory of Oral Diseases, National Clinical Research Center for Oral Diseases, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences Research Unit of Oral Carcinogenesis and Management, West China Hospital of Stomatology, Sichuan University, Chengdu, Sichuan, China.;State Key Laboratory of Oral Diseases, National Clinical Research Center for Oral Diseases, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences Research Unit of Oral Carcinogenesis and Management, West China Hospital of Stomatology, Sichuan University, Chengdu, Sichuan, China.;State Key Laboratory of Oral Diseases, National Clinical Research Center for Oral Diseases, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences Research Unit of Oral Carcinogenesis and Management, West China Hospital of Stomatology, Sichuan University, Chengdu, Sichuan, China. litaiwen@scu.edu.cn.;State Key Laboratory of Oral Diseases, National Clinical Research Center for Oral Diseases, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences Research Unit of Oral Carcinogenesis and Management, West China Hospital of Stomatology, Sichuan University, Chengdu, Sichuan, China.	eng	Nature. 2014 Mar 27;507(7493):462-70;Lancet. 2020 Feb 22;395(10224):565-574;Lancet. 2020 Feb 15;395(10223):470-473;FEBS Lett. 2002 Dec 4;532(1-2):107-10;Mol Biol Evol. 2013 Apr;30(4):772-80;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2005 May 31;102(22):7988-93;Nature. 2020 Feb 3;:;J Pathol. 2004 Jun;203(2):631-7;JAMA. 2020 Feb 7;:;J Med Virol. 2020 Apr;92(4):418-423;Nat Rev Microbiol. 2016 Aug;14(8):523-34;Sci China Life Sci. 2020 Mar;63(3):457-460;FEBS Lett. 2017 Aug;591(15):2213-2225;EBioMedicine. 2015 Jul 10;2(8):851-8;Int J Cancer. 2015 Feb 1;136(3):503-15;J Gen Virol. 2006 Jun;87(Pt 6):1691-5;Eur J Cancer. 2009 Feb;45(3):490-6;J Oral Sci. 2011 Dec;53(4):451-9;Nature. 2003 Nov 27;426(6965):450-4	MEDLINE	epublish

The world is currently witnessing an outbreak of a new coronavirus spreading quickly across China and affecting at least 24 other countries. With almost 65,000 infected, a worldwide death toll of at least 1370 (as of 14 February 2020), and with the potential to affect up to two-thirds of the world population, COVID-19 is considered by the World Health Organization (WHO) to be a global health emergency. The speed of spread and infectivity of COVID-19 (also known as Wuhan-2019-nCoV) are dramatically exceeding those of the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). In fact, since September 2012, the WHO has been notified of 2494 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, whereas the 2002-2003 epidemic of SARS affected 26 countries and resulted in more than 8000 cases. Therefore, although SARS, MERS, and COVID-19 are all the result of coronaviral infections, the causes of the coronaviruses differ dramatically in their transmissibility. It is likely that these differences in infectivity of coronaviruses can be attributed to the differences in the rigidity of their shells which can be evaluated using computational tools for predicting intrinsic disorder predisposition of the corresponding viral proteins.	10	2		10.3390/biom10020331	Goh;Dunker;Foster;Uversky	Gerard Kian-Meng;A Keith;James A;Vladimir N	Goh's BioComputing, Singapore 548957, Singapore.;Center for Computational Biology, Indiana and Bioinformatics, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN 46202, USA.;Department of Biological Sciences, University of Idaho, Moscow, ID 83844, USA.;Institute for Bioinformatics and Evolutionary Studies, University of Idaho, Moscow, ID 83844, USA.;Department of Molecular Medicine, Morsani College of Medicine, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL 33612, USA.;Institute for Biological Instrumentation of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Federal Research Center 'Pushchino Scientific Center for Biological Research of the Russian Academy of Sciences', Moscow region, 142290 Pushchino, Russia.	eng		MEDLINE	epublish

One of the most perplexing questions regarding the current COVID-19 coronavirus epidemic is the discrepancy between the severity of cases observed in the Hubei province of China and those occurring elsewhere in the world. One possible answer is antibody dependent enhancement (ADE) of SARS-CoV-2 due to prior exposure to other coronaviruses. ADE modulates the immune response and can elicit sustained inflammation, lymphopenia, and/or cytokine storm, one or all of which have been documented in severe cases and deaths. ADE also requires prior exposure to similar antigenic epitopes, presumably circulating in local viruses, making it a possible explanation for the observed geographic limitation of severe cases and deaths.	22	2	72-73	10.1016/j.micinf.2020.02.006	Tetro	Jason A	College of Biological Sciences, University of Guelph, Guelph, Ontario, N1G 2W1, Canada.

Traveller screening is being used to limit further spread of COVID-19 following its recent emergence, and symptom screening has become a ubiquitous tool in the global response. Previously, we developed a mathematical model to understand factors governing the effectiveness of traveller screening to prevent spread of emerging pathogens (Gostic et al., 2015). Here, we estimate the impact of different screening programs given current knowledge of key COVID-19 life history and epidemiological parameters. Even under best-case assumptions, we estimate that screening will miss more than half of infected people. Breaking down the factors leading to screening successes and failures, we find that most cases missed by screening are fundamentally undetectable, because they have not yet developed symptoms and are unaware they were exposed. Our work underscores the need for measures to limit transmission by individuals who become ill after being missed by a screening program. These findings can support evidence-based policy to combat the spread of COVID-19, and prospective planning to mitigate future emerging pathogens.	9			10.7554/eLife.55570	Gostic;Gomez;Mummah;Kucharski;Lloyd-Smith	Katelyn;Ana Cr;Riley O;Adam J;James O	Department of Ecology and Evolution, University of Chicago, Chicago, United States.;Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, United States.;Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, United States.;Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, London School of Tropical Hygiene and Medicine, London, United Kingdom.;Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, United States.;Fogarty International Center, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, United States.	eng	BMC Infect Dis. 2010 Mar 30;10:82;Euro Surveill. 2009 Feb 12;14(6):;PLoS One. 2011 Jan 05;6(1):e14490;J Theor Biol. 2008 Sep 7;254(1):178-96;Elife. 2015 Feb 19;4:;Public Health. 2015 Nov;129(11):1471-8;BMJ. 2014 Oct 14;349:g6202;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2004 Apr 20;101(16):6146-51;Nature. 2005 Nov 17;438(7066):355-9	MEDLINE	epublish

Journal of infection in developing countries	J Infect Dev Ctries	1972-2680	2019-nCoV (Wuhan virus), a novel Coronavirus: human-to-human transmission, travel-related cases, and vaccine readiness.	On 31 December 2019 the Wuhan Health Commission reported a cluster of atypical pneumonia cases that was linked to a wet market in the city of Wuhan, China. The first patients began experiencing symptoms of illness in mid-December 2019. Clinical isolates were found to contain a novel coronavirus with similarity to bat coronaviruses. As of 28 January 2020, there are in excess of 4,500 laboratory-confirmed cases, with > 100 known deaths. As with the SARS-CoV, infections in children appear to be rare. Travel-related cases have been confirmed in multiple countries and regions outside mainland China including Germany, France, Thailand, Japan, South Korea, Vietnam, Canada, and the United States, as well as Hong Kong and Taiwan. Domestically in China, the virus has also been noted in several cities and provinces with cases in all but one provinence. While zoonotic transmission appears to be the original source of infections, the most alarming development is that human-to-human transmission is now prevelant. Of particular concern is that many healthcare workers have been infected in the current epidemic. There are several critical clinical questions that need to be resolved, including how efficient is human-to-human transmission? What is the animal reservoir? Is there an intermediate animal reservoir? Do the vaccines generated to the SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV or their proteins offer protection against 2019-nCoV? We offer a research perspective on the next steps for the generation of vaccines.

76	32088333	2020	03			Print-Electronic	Journal Article;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't	Microbes and infection	Microbes Infect.	1769-714X	Lessons learned from the 2019-nCoV epidemic on prevention of future infectious diseases.	Only a month after the outbreak of pneumonia caused by 2019-nCoV, more than forty-thousand people were infected. This put enormous pressure on the Chinese government, medical healthcare provider, and the general public, but also made the international community deeply nervous. On the 25th day after the outbreak, the Chinese government implemented strict traffic restrictions on the area where the 2019-nCoV had originated-Hubei province, whose capital city is Wuhan. Ten days later, the rate of increase of cases in Hubei showed a significant difference (p = 0.0001) compared with the total rate of increase in other provinces of China. These preliminary data suggest the effectiveness of a traffic restriction policy for this pandemic thus far. At the same time, solid financial support and improved research ability, along with network communication technology, also greatly facilitated the application of epidemic prevention measures. These measures were motivated by the need to provide effective treatment of patients, and involved consultation with three major groups in policy formulation-public health experts, the government, and the general public. It was also aided by media and information technology, as well as international cooperation. This experience will provide China and other countries with valuable lessons for quickly coordinating and coping with future public health emergencies.	22	2	86-91	10.1016/j.micinf.2020.02.004	Pan;Ojcius;Gao;Li;Pan;Pan	Xingchen;David M;Tianyue;Zhongsheng;Chunhua;Chungen	Department of Human Resources, Shanghai University of Finance and Economics, Shanghai, China.;Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of the Pacific, School of Dentistry, San Francisco, USA.;Earl Haig Secondary School, North York, Ontario, Canada.;Guangdong Haid Institute of Animal Husbandry & Veterinary, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Research on the Technology of Pig-breeding and Pig-disease Prevention, Haid Research Institute, Guangdong Haid Group Co., Ltd, Guangzhou, China.;The 1st Ward of the Medical Department, Affiliated Cancer Hospital and Institute of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, China.

At the end of December 2019, a novel coronavirus, 2019-nCoV, caused an outbreak of pneumonia spreading from Wuhan, Hubei province, to the whole country of China, which has posed great threats to public health and attracted enormous attention around the world. To date, there are no clinically approved vaccines or antiviral drugs available for these human coronavirus infections. Intensive research on the novel emerging human infectious coronaviruses is urgently needed to elucidate their route of transmission and pathogenic mechanisms, and to identify potential drug targets, which would promote the development of effective preventive and therapeutic countermeasures. Herein, we describe the epidemic and etiological characteristics of 2019-nCoV, discuss its essential biological features, including tropism and receptor usage, summarize approaches for disease prevention and treatment, and speculate on the transmission route of 2019-nCoV.	22	2	80-85	10.1016/j.micinf.2020.02.002	Li;You;Wang;Zhou;Qiu;Luo;Ge	Jin-Yan;Zhi;Qiong;Zhi-Jian;Ye;Rui;Xing-Yi	Institute of Pathogen Biology and Immunology, College of Biology, Hunan Provincial Key Laboratory of Medical Virology, Hunan University, Changsha 410082, Hunan, China.

Since late December 2019, an outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus diseases (COVID-19) in Wuhan, China has spread quickly nationwide. With the spread of COVID-19, the routine clinical diagnosis and treatment for lung cancer patients has been disturbed. Due to the systemic immunosuppressive of lung cancer patients caused by the malignancy and anticancer treatments, lung cancer patients are more susceptible to infection than healthy individuals. Furthermore, patients with cancer had poorer prognosis from infection. Lung cancer patients should be the priority group for COVID-19 prevention. The protection provisions and control measures aiming to protect lung cancer patients from COVID-19 have been increasingly concerned. During the COVID-19 outbreak period, it should be carefully differentiated for fever and respiratory symptoms for lung cancer patients receiving anti-tumor treatment, in order to evaluate the risk of COVID-19. Moreover, it is necessary to carry out meticulous and individualized clinical management for lung cancer patients to effectively protect the patients from COVID-19.;【中文题目：新型冠状病毒肺炎疫情期间肺癌患者临床管理】 【中文摘要：自2019年12月底以来，湖北省武汉市陆续发现多例新型冠状病毒肺炎（简称：新冠肺炎，2019 novel coronavirus disease，COVID-19），并在全国范围内蔓延。随着新冠肺炎疫情的蔓延，肺癌患者的常规医疗受到影响。由于肺癌患者接受抗肿瘤治疗后免疫力低，合并感染后症状重，应是疫情防治的重点对象，肺癌患者对新冠肺炎的防范措施日益受到关注。复杂严峻的新冠肺炎疫情下，接受抗肿瘤治疗的肺癌患者如出现发热及呼吸道症状，更需要仔细地进行鉴别诊断，评估新冠肺炎感染的风险。对于肺癌患者，在新冠肺炎疫情期间，需要进行精细化和个体化的管理，最大程度地保护患者，有效防范新冠肺炎。】 【中文关键词：肺肿瘤；患者管理； 新型冠状病毒肺炎】.	23			10.3779/j.issn.1009-3419.2020.03.02	Xu;Liu;Hu;Wang	Yan;Hongsheng;Ke;Mengzhao	Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100730, China.;Department of Thoracic Surgery, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100730, China.;Department of Radiation Oncology, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100730, China.;Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100730, China.	chi		MEDLINE	ppublish

Science	1095-9203	Cryo-EM structure of the 2019-nCoV spike in the prefusion conformation.	The outbreak of a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) represents a pandemic threat that has been declared a public health emergency of international concern. The CoV spike (S) glycoprotein is a key target for vaccines, therapeutic antibodies, and diagnostics. To facilitate medical countermeasure development, we determined a 3.5-angstrom-resolution cryo-electron microscopy structure of the 2019-nCoV S trimer in the prefusion conformation. The predominant state of the trimer has one of the three receptor-binding domains (RBDs) rotated up in a receptor-accessible conformation. We also provide biophysical and structural evidence that the 2019-nCoV S protein binds angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) with higher affinity than does severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV S. Additionally, we tested several published SARS-CoV RBD-specific monoclonal antibodies and found that they do not have appreciable binding to 2019-nCoV S, suggesting that antibody cross-reactivity may be limited between the two RBDs. The structure of 2019-nCoV S should enable the rapid development and evaluation of medical countermeasures to address the ongoing public health crisis.	367	6483	1260-1263	10.1126/science.abb2507	Wrapp;Wang;Corbett;Goldsmith;Hsieh;Abiona;Graham;McLellan	Daniel;Nianshuang;Kizzmekia S;Jory A;Ching-Lin;Olubukola;Barney S;Jason S	Department of Molecular Biosciences, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX 78712, USA.;Department of Molecular Biosciences, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX 78712, USA.;Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.;Department of Molecular Biosciences, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX 78712, USA.;Department of Molecular Biosciences, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX 78712, USA.;Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.;Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.;Department of Molecular Biosciences, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX 78712, USA. jmclellan@austin.utexas.edu.	eng		MEDLINE	ppublish

A novel coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, SARS-CoV-2) causing a cluster of respiratory infections (coronavirus disease 2019, COVID-19) in Wuhan, China, was identified on 7 January 2020. The epidemic quickly disseminated from Wuhan and as at 12 February 2020, 45,179 cases have been confirmed in 25 countries, including 1,116 deaths. Strengthened surveillance was implemented in France on 10 January 2020 in order to identify imported cases early and prevent secondary transmission. Three categories of risk exposure and follow-up procedure were defined for contacts. Three cases of COVID-19 were confirmed on 24 January, the first cases in Europe. Contact tracing was immediately initiated. Five contacts were evaluated as at low risk of exposure and 18 at moderate/high risk. As at 12 February 2020, two cases have been discharged and the third one remains symptomatic with a persistent cough, and no secondary transmission has been identified. Effective collaboration between all parties involved in the surveillance and response to emerging threats is required to detect imported cases early and to implement adequate control measures.	25	6		10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2020.25.6.2000094	Bernard Stoecklin;Rolland;Silue;Mailles;Campese;Simondon;Mechain;Meurice;Nguyen;Bassi;Yamani;Behillil;Ismael;Nguyen;Malvy;Lescure;Georges;Lazarus;Tabaï;Stempfelet;Enouf;Coignard;Levy-Bruhl;Investigation Team	Sibylle;Patrick;Yassoungo;Alexandra;Christine;Anne;Matthieu;Laure;Mathieu;Clément;Estelle;Sylvie;Sophie;Duc;Denis;François Xavier;Scarlett;Clément;Anouk;Morgane;Vincent;Bruno;Daniel	Santé publique France, Direction des maladies infectieuses, Saint-Maurice, France.;Santé publique France, Direction des régions, Saint-Maurice, France.;Santé publique France, Direction des régions, Cellule Régionale Ile-de-France, Paris, France.;Santé publique France, Direction des maladies infectieuses, Saint-Maurice, France.;Santé publique France, Direction des maladies infectieuses, Saint-Maurice, France.;Agence Régionale de Santé Ile-de-France, Paris, France.;Agence Régionale de Santé Nouvelle-Aquitaine, Bordeaux, France.;Santé publique France, Direction des régions, Cellule Régionale Nouvelle-Aquitaine, Bordeaux, France.;Agence Régionale de Santé Nouvelle-Aquitaine, Bordeaux, France.;Santé publique France, Direction des régions, Cellule Régionale Ile-de-France, Paris, France.;Agence Régionale de Santé Ile-de-France, Paris, France.;Centre National de Référence des virus des infections respiratoires, dont la grippe, Institut Pasteur, Paris, France.;AP-HP, Hôpital Bichat, Service des maladies infectieuses et tropicales, Paris, France.;Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Bordeaux, Service des maladies infectieuses et tropicales, Bordeaux GeoSentinel Site, Bordeaux, France.;UMR 1219, Université de Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France.;Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Bordeaux, Service des maladies infectieuses et tropicales, Bordeaux GeoSentinel Site, Bordeaux, France.;Université de Paris, IAME, INSERM, Paris, France.;AP-HP, Hôpital Bichat, Service des maladies infectieuses et tropicales, Paris, France.;Santé publique France, Direction des maladies infectieuses, Saint-Maurice, France.;Direction Générale de la Santé, Ministère des solidarités et de la santé, Centre opérationnel de réception et de régulation des urgences sanitaires et sociales, Paris, France.;Santé publique France, Direction alerte et crise, Saint-Maurice, France.;Santé publique France, Direction alerte et crise, Saint-Maurice, France.;Centre National de Référence des virus des infections respiratoires, dont la grippe, Institut Pasteur, Paris, France.;Santé publique France, Direction des maladies infectieuses, Saint-Maurice, France.;Santé publique France, Direction des maladies infectieuses, Saint-Maurice, France.;The members of the investigation team are listed at the end of the article.	eng	Lancet. 2020 Feb 15;395(10223):514-523;Euro Surveill. 2020 Jan;25(3):;Lancet. 2020 Feb 29;395(10225):689-697;Euro Surveill. 2020 Jan;25(4):;N Engl J Med. 2020 Jan 29;:	MEDLINE	ppublish

A novel type of coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infecting humans appeared in Wuhan, China, at the end of December 2019. Since the identification of the outbreak the infection quickly spread involving in one month more than 31,000 confirmed cases with 638 death. Molecular analysis suggest that 2019-nCoV could be originated from bats after passaging in intermediate hosts, highlighting the high zoonotic potential of coronaviruses.	77	9		10.1093/femspd/ftaa006	Salata;Calistri;Parolin;Palù	Cristiano;Arianna;Cristina;Giorgio	Department of Molecular Medicine, University of Padova, Via Gabelli 63, 35121, Padova, Italy.;Department of Molecular Medicine, University of Padova, Via Gabelli 63, 35121, Padova, Italy.;Department of Molecular Medicine, University of Padova, Via Gabelli 63, 35121, Padova, Italy.;Department of Molecular Medicine, University of Padova, Via Gabelli 63, 35121, Padova, Italy.	eng		MEDLINE	ppublish

In December 2019, a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) caused an outbreak in Wuhan, China, and soon spread to other parts of the world. It was believed that 2019-nCoV was transmitted through respiratory tract and then induced pneumonia, thus molecular diagnosis based on oral swabs was used for confirmation of this disease. Likewise, patient will be released upon two times of negative detection from oral swabs. However, many coronaviruses can also be transmitted through oral-fecal route by infecting intestines. Whether 2019-nCoV infected patients also carry virus in other organs like intestine need to be tested. We conducted investigation on patients in a local hospital who were infected with this virus. We found the presence of 2019-nCoV in anal swabs and blood as well, and more anal swab positives than oral swab positives in a later stage of infection, suggesting shedding and thereby transmitted through oral-fecal route. We also showed serology test can improve detection positive rate thus should be used in future epidemiology. Our report provides a cautionary warning that 2019-nCoV may be shed through multiple routes.	9	1	386-389	10.1080/22221751.2020.1729071	Zhang;Du;Li;Zheng;Yang;Hu;Wang;Xiao;Yan;Shi;Zhou	Wei;Rong-Hui;Bei;Xiao-Shuang;Xing-Lou;Ben;Yan-Yi;Geng-Fu;Bing;Zheng-Li;Peng	CAS Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Center for Biosafety Mega-Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan, People's Republic of China.;Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital, Wuhan, People's Republic of China.;CAS Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Center for Biosafety Mega-Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan, People's Republic of China.;CAS Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Center for Biosafety Mega-Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan, People's Republic of China.;CAS Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Center for Biosafety Mega-Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan, People's Republic of China.;CAS Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Center for Biosafety Mega-Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan, People's Republic of China.;CAS Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Center for Biosafety Mega-Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan, People's Republic of China.;CAS Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Center for Biosafety Mega-Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan, People's Republic of China.;CAS Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Center for Biosafety Mega-Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan, People's Republic of China.;CAS Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Center for Biosafety Mega-Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan, People's Republic of China.;CAS Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Center for Biosafety Mega-Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan, People's Republic of China.	eng	N Engl J Med. 2020 Feb 20;382(8):727-733;Virol Sin. 2018 Feb;33(1):104-107;J Pathol. 2004 Jun;203(2):622-30;Am J Gastroenterol. 2005 Jan;100(1):169-76;Sci Adv. 2017 Nov 15;3(11):eaao4966;N Engl J Med. 2020 Jan 29;:	MEDLINE	ppublish
100	32065055	2020	Dec			Print	Letter	Emerging microbes & infections	Emerg Microbes Infect	2222-1751	Potent binding of 2019 novel coronavirus spike protein by a SARS coronavirus-specific human monoclonal antibody.	The newly identified 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has caused more than 11,900 laboratory-confirmed human infections, including 259 deaths, posing a serious threat to human health. Currently, however, there is no specific antiviral treatment or vaccine. Considering the relatively high identity of receptor-binding domain (RBD) in 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV, it is urgent to assess the cross-reactivity of anti-SARS CoV antibodies with 2019-nCoV spike protein, which could have important implications for rapid development of vaccines and therapeutic antibodies against 2019-nCoV. Here, we report for the first time that a SARS-CoV-specific human monoclonal antibody, CR3022, could bind potently with 2019-nCoV RBD (KD of 6.3 nM). The epitope of CR3022 does not overlap with the ACE2 binding site within 2019-nCoV RBD. These results suggest that CR3022 may have the potential to be developed as candidate therapeutics, alone or in combination with other neutralizing antibodies, for the prevention and treatment of 2019-nCoV infections. Interestingly, some of the most potent SARS-CoV-specific neutralizing antibodies (e.g. m396, CR3014) that target the ACE2 binding site of SARS-CoV failed to bind 2019-nCoV spike protein, implying that the difference in the RBD of SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV has a critical impact for the cross-reactivity of neutralizing antibodies, and that it is still necessary to develop novel monoclonal antibodies that could bind specifically to 2019-nCoV RBD.	9	1	382-385	10.1080/22221751.2020.1729069	Tian;Li;Huang;Xia;Lu;Shi;Lu;Jiang;Yang;Wu;Ying	Xiaolong;Cheng;Ailing;Shuai;Sicong;Zhengli;Lu;Shibo;Zhenlin;Yanling;Tianlei	MOE/NHC/CAMS Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, Shanghai, People's Republic of China.;MOE/NHC/CAMS Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, Shanghai, People's Republic of China.;MOE/NHC/CAMS Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, Shanghai, People's Republic of China.;MOE/NHC/CAMS Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, Shanghai, People's Republic of China.;MOE/NHC/CAMS Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, Shanghai, People's Republic of China.;CAS Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Center for Biosafety Mega-Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan, People's Republic of China.;MOE/NHC/CAMS Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, Shanghai, People's Republic of China.;MOE/NHC/CAMS Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, Shanghai, People's Republic of China.;Department of Pulmonary Medicine, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, People's Republic of China.;MOE/NHC/CAMS Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, Shanghai, People's Republic of China.;MOE/NHC/CAMS Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, Shanghai, People's Republic of China.	eng	Nature. 2020 Mar;579(7798):270-273;Lancet. 2004 Jun 26;363(9427):2139-41;Nat Commun. 2015 Sep 15;6:8223;Emerg Microbes Infect. 2020 Dec;9(1):221-236;Virology. 2001 Jan 20;279(2):371-4;PLoS Med. 2006 Jul;3(7):e237;Nat Med. 2004 Aug;10(8):871-5;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2007 Jul 17;104(29):12123-8;J Biol Chem. 2006 Nov 10;281(45):34610-6;Science. 2005 Sep 16;309(5742):1864-8;J Mol Biol. 2009 May 15;388(4):815-23;J Biol Chem. 2004 Jan 30;279(5):3197-201;J Biol Chem. 2006 Jun 9;281(23):15829-36;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2004 Feb 24;101(8):2536-41;Cell. 2019 Feb 21;176(5):1026-1039.e15	MEDLINE	ppublish

On December 31, 2019, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission announced an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), China is now at a critical period in the control of the epidemic. The Chinese Government has been taking a series of rapid, comprehensive, and effective prevention and control measures. As the pandemic has developed, a fact has become apparent: there is a serious dearth of emergency medical supplies, and especially an extreme shortage of personal protective equipment such as masks and medical protective clothing. This is one of the major factors affecting the progress of epidemic prevention and control. Although China has made great efforts to strengthen the ability to quickly respond to public health emergencies since the SARS outbreak in 2003 and it has clarified requirements for emergency supplies through legislation, the emergency reserve supplies program has not been effectively implemented, and there are also deficiencies in the types, quantity, and availability of emergency medical supplies. A sound system of emergency reserve supplies is crucial to the management of public health emergencies. Based on international experiences with pandemic control, the world should emphasize improving the system of emergency reserve medical supplies in the process of establishing and improving public health emergency response systems, and it should promote the establishment of international cooperative programs to jointly deal with public health emergencies of international concern in the future.	14	1	3-8	10.5582/bst.2020.01043	Wang;Zhang;He	Xu;Xiaoxi;Jiangjiang	Department of Health Policy Research, Shanghai Health Development Research Center (Shanghai Medical Information Center), Shanghai, China.;Department of Health Policy Research, Shanghai Health Development Research Center (Shanghai Medical Information Center), Shanghai, China.;Department of Health Policy Research, Shanghai Health Development Research Center (Shanghai Medical Information Center), Shanghai, China.	eng		MEDLINE	ppublish

Sci.	1598-6357	Case of the Index Patient Who Caused Tertiary Transmission of COVID-19 Infection in Korea: the Application of Lopinavir/Ritonavir for the Treatment of COVID-19 Infected Pneumonia Monitored by Quantitative RT-PCR.	Since mid-December of 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection has been spreading from Wuhan, China. The confirmed COVID-19 patients in South Korea are those who came from or visited China. As secondary transmissions have occurred and the speed of transmission is accelerating, there are rising concerns about community infections. The 54-year old male is the third patient diagnosed with COVID-19 infection in Korea. He is a worker for a clothing business and had mild respiratory symptoms and intermittent fever in the beginning of hospitalization, and pneumonia symptoms on chest computerized tomography scan on day 6 of admission. This patient caused one case of secondary transmission and three cases of tertiary transmission. Hereby, we report the clinical findings of the index patient who was the first to cause tertiary transmission outside China. Interestingly, after lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra, AbbVie) was administered, β-coronavirus viral loads significantly decreased and no or little coronavirus titers were observed.	35	6	e79	10.3346/jkms.2020.35.e79	Lim;Jeon;Shin;Kim;Seong;Lee;Choe;Kang;Lee;Park	Jaegyun;Seunghyun;Hyun Young;Moon Jung;Yu Min;Wang Jun;Kang Won;Yu Min;Baeckseung;Sang Joon	Department of Laboratory Medicine, Myongji Hospital, Hanyang University College of Medicine, Goyang, Korea.;New Horizon Cancer Institute, Myongji Hospital, Goyang, Korea.;Department of Family Medicine, Myongji Hospital, Hanyang University College of Medicine, Goyang, Korea.;Department of Laboratory Medicine, Myongji Hospital, Hanyang University College of Medicine, Goyang, Korea.;Department of Internal Medicine, Myongji Hospital, Goyang, Korea.;Office of Chief Executive Officer and Chairman, Department of General Surgery, Myongji Hospital, Goyang, Korea.;Department of Infectious Diseases, Myongji Hospital, Goyang, Korea.;Department of Infectious Diseases, Myongji Hospital, Goyang, Korea.;CancerROP, Seoul, Korea. baeckseung@gmail.com.;Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Myongji Hospital, Goyang, Korea. drjoseph@mjh.or.kr.	eng	J Korean Med Sci. 2020 Feb 10;35(5):e61;Brain Behav Immun. 2019 Feb;76:280-283;N Engl J Med. 2020 Jan 29;:;N Engl J Med. 2020 Jan 30;:;JAMA. 2020 Feb 7;:	MEDLINE	epublish

First reported from Wuhan, The People's Republic of China, on 31 December 2019, the ongoing outbreak of a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) causes great global concerns. Based on the advice of the International Health Regulations Emergency Committee and the fact that to date 24 other countries also reported cases, the WHO Director-General declared that the outbreak of 2019-nCoV constitutes a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on 30 January 2020. Together with the other two highly pathogenic coronaviruses, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), 2019-nCov and other yet to be identified coronaviruses pose a global threat to public health. In this mini-review, we provide a brief introduction to the pathology and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and extrapolate this knowledge to the newly identified 2019-nCoV.	92	5	491-494	10.1002/jmv.25709	Liu;Zheng;Tong;Li;Wang;Sutter;Trilling;Lu;Dittmer;Yang	Jia;Xin;Qiaoxia;Wei;Baoju;Kathrin;Mirko;Mengji;Ulf;Dongliang	Department of Infectious Diseases, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China.;Joint International Laboratory of Infection and Immunity, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China.;Department of Infectious Diseases, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China.;Joint International Laboratory of Infection and Immunity, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China.;Department of Infectious Diseases, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China.;Department of Infectious Diseases, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China.;Department of Infectious Diseases, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China.;Joint International Laboratory of Infection and Immunity, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China.;Institute for Virology, University Hospital of Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.;Joint International Laboratory of Infection and Immunity, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China.;Institute for Virology, University Hospital of Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.;Joint International Laboratory of Infection and Immunity, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China.;Institute for Virology, University Hospital of Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.;Joint International Laboratory of Infection and Immunity, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China.;Institute for Virology, University Hospital of Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.;Joint International Laboratory of Infection and Immunity, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China.;Department of Infectious Diseases, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China.;Joint International Laboratory of Infection and Immunity, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China.	eng	http://wjw.wuhan.gov.cn/front/web/showDetail/2019123108989.

The outbreak of a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) since December 2019 in Wuhan, the major transportation hub in central China, became an emergency of major international concern. While several etiological studies have begun to reveal the specific biological features of this virus, the epidemic characteristics need to be elucidated. Notably, a long incubation time was reported to be associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, leading to adjustments in screening and control policies. To avoid the risk of virus spread, all potentially exposed subjects are required to be isolated for 14 days, which is the longest predicted incubation time. However, based on our analysis of a larger dataset available so far, we find there is no observable difference between the incubation time for SARS-CoV-2, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), highlighting the need for larger and well-annotated datasets.	92	5	476-478	10.1002/jmv.25708	Jiang;Rayner;Luo	Xuan;Simon;Min-Hua	The Joint Center of Translational Precision Medicine Guangzhou Institute of Pediatrics, Guangzhou Women and Children Medical Center, Guangzhou, China.;The Joint Center of Translational Precision Medicine, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan, China.;Department of Medical Genetics, Oslo University Hospital and University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.;Hybrid Technology Hub-Centre of Excellence, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.;Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan, China.;The Joint Center of Translational Precision Medicine Guangzhou Institute of Pediatrics, Guangzhou Women and Children Medical Center, Guangzhou, China.;The Joint Center of Translational Precision Medicine, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan, China.;Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan, China.;State Key Laboratory of Virology, CAS Center for Excellence in Brain Science and Intelligence Technology (CEBSIT), Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan, China.;University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.	eng	Zhu N, Zhang D, Wang W, et al.

Rep.	1545-861X	Persons Evaluated for 2019 Novel Coronavirus - United States, January 2020.	In December 2019, a cluster of cases of pneumonia emerged in Wuhan City in central China's Hubei Province. Genetic sequencing of isolates obtained from patients with pneumonia identified a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) as the etiology (1). As of February 4, 2020, approximately 20,000 confirmed cases had been identified in China and an additional 159 confirmed cases in 23 other countries, including 11 in the United States (2,3). On January 17, CDC and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's Customs and Border Protection began health screenings at U.S. airports to identify ill travelers returning from Wuhan City (4). CDC activated its Emergency Operations Center on January 21 and formalized a process for inquiries regarding persons suspected of having 2019-nCoV infection (2). As of January 31, 2020, CDC had responded to clinical inquiries from public health officials and health care providers to assist in evaluating approximately 650 persons thought to be at risk for 2019-nCoV infection. Guided by CDC criteria for the evaluation of persons under investigation (PUIs) (5), 210 symptomatic persons were tested for 2019-nCoV; among these persons, 148 (70%) had travel-related risk only, 42 (20%) had close contact with an ill laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV patient or PUI, and 18 (9%) had both travel- and contact-related risks. Eleven of these persons had laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection. Recognizing persons at risk for 2019-nCoV is critical to identifying cases and preventing further transmission. Health care providers should remain vigilant and adhere to recommended infection prevention and control practices when evaluating patients for possible 2019-nCoV infection (6). Providers should consult with their local and state health departments when assessing not only ill travelers from 2019-nCoV-affected countries but also ill persons who have been in close contact with patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection in the United States.	69	6	166-170	10.15585/mmwr.mm6906e1	Bajema;Oster;McGovern;Lindstrom;Stenger;Anderson;Isenhour;Clarke;Evans;Chu;Biggs;Kirking;Gerber;Hall;Fry;Oliver	Kristina L;Alexandra M;Olivia L;Stephen;Mark R;Tara C;Cheryl;Kevin R;Mary E;Victoria T;Holly M;Hannah L;Susan I;Aron J;Alicia M;Sara E		eng	N Engl J Med. 2020 Feb 20;382(8):727-733;N Engl J Med. 2020 Jan 28;:;MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep. 2020 Feb 07;69(5):140-146	MEDLINE	epublish

Virol.	1096-9071	Potential interventions for novel coronavirus in China: A systematic review.	An outbreak of a novel coronavirus (COVID-19 or 2019-CoV) infection has posed significant threats to international health and the economy. In the absence of treatment for this virus, there is an urgent need to find alternative methods to control the spread of disease. Here, we have conducted an online search for all treatment options related to coronavirus infections as well as some RNA-virus infection and we have found that general treatments, coronavirus-specific treatments, and antiviral treatments should be useful in fighting COVID-19. We suggest that the nutritional status of each infected patient should be evaluated before the administration of general treatments and the current children's RNA-virus vaccines including influenza vaccine should be immunized for uninfected people and health care workers. In addition, convalescent plasma should be given to COVID-19 patients if it is available. In conclusion, we suggest that all the potential interventions be implemented to control the emerging COVID-19 if the infection is uncontrollable.	92	5	479-490	10.1002/jmv.25707	Zhang;Liu	Lei;Yunhui	Department of Neurosurgery, Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, Liaoning, China.;Department of Neurosurgery, Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, Liaoning, China.	eng	Banerjee A, Kulcsar K, Misra V, Frieman M, Mossman K.

To estimate the basic reproduction number of the Wuhan novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).;Based on the susceptible-exposed-infected-removed (SEIR) compartment model and the assumption that the infectious cases with symptoms occurred before 26 January, 2020 are resulted from free propagation without intervention, we estimate the basic reproduction number of 2019-nCoV according to the reported confirmed cases and suspected cases, as well as the theoretical estimated number of infected cases by other research teams, together with some epidemiological determinants learned from the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).;The basic reproduction number fall between 2.8 and 3.3 by using the real-time reports on the number of 2019-nCoV-infected cases from People's Daily in China and fall between 3.2 and 3.9 on the basis of the predicted number of infected cases from international colleagues.;The early transmission ability of 2019-nCoV is close to or slightly higher than SARS. It is a controllable disease with moderate to high transmissibility. Timely and effective control measures are needed to prevent the further transmissions.	13	1	3-7	10.1111/jebm.12376	Zhou;Liu;Yang;Liao;Yang;Bai;Lu;Zhang	Tao;Quanhui;Zimo;Jingyi;Kexin;Wei;Xin;Wei	Big Data Research Center, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, 611731, China.;College of Computer Science, Sichuan University, Chengdu, 610065, China.;Beijing AiQiYi Science & Technology Co.

Life sciences	Sci China Life Sci	1869-1889	Clinical and biochemical indexes from 2019-nCoV infected patients linked to viral loads and lung injury.	The outbreak of the 2019-nCoV infection began in December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei province, and rapidly spread to many provinces in China as well as other countries. Here we report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics, as well as potential biomarkers for predicting disease severity in 2019-nCoV-infected patients in Shenzhen, China. All 12 cases of the 2019-nCoV-infected patients developed pneumonia and half of them developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The most common laboratory abnormalities were hypoalbuminemia, lymphopenia, decreased percentage of lymphocytes (LYM) and neutrophils (NEU), elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and decreased CD8 count. The viral load of 2019-nCoV detected from patient respiratory tracts was positively linked to lung disease severity. ALB, LYM, LYM (%), LDH, NEU (%), and CRP were highly correlated to the acute lung injury. Age, viral load, lung injury score, and blood biochemistry indexes, albumin (ALB), CRP, LDH, LYM (%), LYM, and NEU (%), may be predictors of disease severity. Moreover, the Angiotensin II level in the plasma sample from 2019-nCoV infected patients was markedly elevated and linearly associated to viral load and lung injury. Our results suggest a number of potential diagnosis biomarkers and angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) drugs for potential repurposing treatment of 2019-nCoV infection.	63	3	364-374	10.1007/s11427-020-1643-8	Liu;Yang;Zhang;Huang;Wang;Yuan;Wang;Li;Li;Feng;Zhang;Wang;Peng;Chen;Qin;Zhao;Tan;Yin;Xu;Zhou;Jiang;Liu	Yingxia;Yang;Cong;Fengming;Fuxiang;Jing;Zhaoqin;Jinxiu;Jianming;Cheng;Zheng;Lifei;Ling;Li;Yuhao;Dandan;Shuguang;Lu;Jun;Congzhao;Chengyu;Lei	Shenzhen

A novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is causing an outbreak of viral pneumonia that started in Wuhan, China. Using the travel history and symptom onset of 88 confirmed cases that were detected outside Wuhan in the early outbreak phase, we estimate the mean incubation period to be 6.4 days (95% credible interval: 5.6-7.7), ranging from 2.1 to 11.1 days (2.5th to 97.5th percentile). These values should help inform 2019-nCoV case definitions and appropriate quarantine durations.	25	5		10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2020.25.5.2000062	Backer;Klinkenberg;Wallinga	Jantien A;Don;Jacco	Centre for Infectious Disease Control, National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM), Bilthoven, Netherlands.;Centre for Infectious Disease Control, National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM), Bilthoven, Netherlands.;Department of Biomedical Data Sciences, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, Netherlands.;Centre for Infectious Disease Control, National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM), Bilthoven, Netherlands.	eng	N Engl J Med. 2020 Feb 20;382(8):727-733;Lancet Infect Dis. 2014 Jan;14(1):50-56;Int J Infect Dis. 2020 Jan 30;92:214-217;J Clin Med. 2020 Jan 24;9(2):;N Engl J Med. 2020 Jan 29;:;N Engl J Med. 2013 Aug 1;369(5):407-16;Lancet. 2020 Jan 31;:;Lancet. 2003 May 24;361(9371):1761-6;BMC Infect Dis. 2010 Mar 06;10:50;Lancet. 2020 Feb 15;395(10223):514-523;Sci Rep. 2016 Oct 24;6:35839;Epidemiology. 2007 Mar;18(2):253-9;Lancet Infect Dis. 2009 May;9(5):291-300	MEDLINE	ppublish

International health	Int Health	1876-3405	A qualitative study of zoonotic risk factors among rural communities in southern China.	Strategies are urgently needed to mitigate the risk of zoonotic disease emergence in southern China, where pathogens with zoonotic potential are known to circulate in wild animal populations. However, the risk factors leading to emergence are poorly understood, which presents a challenge in developing appropriate mitigation strategies for local communities.;Residents in rural communities of Yunnan, Guangxi and Guangdong provinces were recruited and enrolled in this study. Data were collected through ethnographic interviews and field observations, and thematically coded and analysed to identify both risk and protective factors for zoonotic disease emergence at the individual, community and policy levels.;Eighty-eight ethnographic interviews and 55 field observations were conducted at nine selected sites. Frequent human-animal interactions and low levels of environmental biosecurity in local communities were identified as risks for zoonotic disease emergence. Policies and programmes existing in the communities provide opportunities for zoonotic risk mitigation.;This study explored the relationship among zoonotic risk and human behaviour, environment and policies in rural communities in southern China. It identifies key behavioural risk factors that can be targeted for development of tailored risk-mitigation strategies to reduce the threat of novel zoonoses.	12	2	77-85	10.1093/inthealth/ihaa001	Li;Zhu;Zhang;Zhang;Hagan;Martinez;Chmura;Francisco;Tai;Miller;Daszak	Hong-Ying;Guang-Jian;Yun-Zhi;Li-Biao;Emily A;Stephanie;Aleksei A;Leilani;Hina;Maureen;Peter	EcoHealth Alliance, 460 West 34th Street, New York, NY 10001, USA.;EcoHealth Alliance, 460 West 34th Street, New York, NY 10001, USA.;Institute of Preventive Medicine, Dali University, Dali, 671000, China.;Guangdong Institute of Applied Biological Resources, Guangdong Academy of Sciences, #105 Xingang Road West, Guangzhou, 510260, China.;EcoHealth Alliance, 460 West 34th Street, New York, NY 10001, USA.;EcoHealth Alliance, 460 West 34th Street, New York, NY 10001, USA.;EcoHealth Alliance, 460 West 34th Street, New York, NY 10001, USA.;Henry M Jackson Foundation for the Advancement of Military Medicine, Bethesda, MD 20817, USA.;School of Medicine, St. George's University, Great River, NY 11739, USA.;Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA.;EcoHealth Alliance, 460 West 34th Street, New York, NY 10001, USA.	eng	Lancet Infect Dis. 2016 Feb;16(2):252-8;BMC Infect Dis. 2018 Feb 27;18(1):96;PLoS One. 2012;7(2):e31076;Virol Sin. 2018 Feb;33(1):104-107;Lancet. 2008 Nov 1;372(9649):1598-605;Virus Res. 2015 Jul 2;205:1-6;Viruses. 2019 Mar 02;11(3):;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2013 May 21;110(21):8399-404;Int J Infect Dis. 2014 Aug;25:65-72;PLoS One. 2018 Apr 3;13(4):e0194647;Qual Life Res. 2009 Nov;18(9):1263-78;Curr Opin Virol. 2019 Feb;34:79-89;Nat Commun. 2017 Oct 24;8(1):1124;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2017 Feb 14;114(7):1601-1606;Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2015 Jun 2;112(22):7039-44;Health Econ. 2008 Feb;17(2):149-65;Microbiome. 2018 Oct 3;6(1):178;Lancet. 2012 Dec 1;380(9857):1936-45	MEDLINE	ppublish

Infect.	1532-2939	Persistence of coronaviruses on inanimate surfaces and their inactivation with biocidal agents.	Currently, the emergence of a novel human coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has become a global health concern causing severe respiratory tract infections in humans. Human-to-human transmissions have been described with incubation times between 2-10 days, facilitating its spread via droplets, contaminated hands or surfaces. We therefore reviewed the literature on all available information about the persistence of human and veterinary coronaviruses on inanimate surfaces as well as inactivation strategies with biocidal agents used for chemical disinfection, e.g. in healthcare facilities. The analysis of 22 studies reveals that human coronaviruses such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronavirus or endemic human coronaviruses (HCoV) can persist on inanimate surfaces like metal, glass or plastic for up to 9 days, but can be efficiently inactivated by surface disinfection procedures with 62-71% ethanol, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide or 0.1% sodium hypochlorite within 1 minute. Other biocidal agents such as 0.05-0.2% benzalkonium chloride or 0.02% chlorhexidine digluconate are less effective. As no specific therapies are available for SARS-CoV-2, early containment and prevention of further spread will be crucial to stop the ongoing outbreak and to control this novel infectious thread.	104	3	246-251	10.1016/j.jhin.2020.01.022	Kampf;Todt;Pfaender;Steinmann	G;D;S;E	University Medicine Greifswald, Institute for Hygiene and Environmental Medicine, Ferdinand-Sauerbruch-Straße, 17475 Greifswald, Germany.

In about 20 days since the diagnosis of the first case of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in Korea on January 20, 2020, 28 cases have been confirmed. Fifteen patients (53.6%) of them were male and median age of was 42 years (range, 20-73). Of the confirmed cases, 16, 9, and 3 were index (57.2%), first-generation (32.1%), and second-generation (10.7%) cases, respectively. All first-generation and second-generation patients were family members or intimate acquaintances of the index cases with close contacts. Fifteen among 16 index patients had entered Korea from January 19 to 24, 2020 while 1 patient had entered Korea on January 31, 2020. The average incubation period was 3.9 days (median, 3.0), and the reproduction number was estimated as 0.48. Three of the confirmed patients were asymptomatic when they were diagnosed. Epidemiological indicators will be revised with the availability of additional data in the future. Sharing epidemiological information among researchers worldwide is essential for efficient preparation and response in tackling this new infectious disease.	42		e2020007	10.4178/epih.e2020007	Ki	Moran	Department of Cancer Control and Population Health, Graduate School of Cancer Science and Policy, National Cancer Center, Goyang, Korea.	eng		MEDLINE	ppublish

A zoonotic coronavirus, tentatively labeled as 2019-nCoV by the World Health Organization (WHO), has been identified as the causative agent of the viral pneumonia outbreak in Wuhan, China, at the end of 2019. Although 2019-nCoV can cause a severe respiratory illness like SARS and MERS, evidence from clinics suggested that 2019-nCoV is generally less pathogenic than SARS-CoV, and much less than MERS-CoV. The transmissibility of 2019-nCoV is still debated and needs to be further assessed. To avoid the 2019-nCoV outbreak turning into an epidemic or even a pandemic and to minimize the mortality rate, China activated emergency response procedures, but much remains to be learned about the features of the virus to refine the risk assessment and response. Here, the current knowledge in 2019-nCoV pathogenicity and transmissibility is summarized in comparison with several commonly known emerging viruses, and information urgently needed for a better control of the disease is highlighted.	22	2	69-71	10.1016/j.micinf.2020.01.004	Chen	Jieliang	Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology (MOE/NHC/CAMS), School of Basic Medical Sciences, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.

In December 2019, a new type viral pneumonia cases occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province; and then named "2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)" by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 12 January 2020. For it is a never been experienced respiratory disease before and with infection ability widely and quickly, it attracted the world's attention but without treatment and control manual. For the request from frontline clinicians and public health professionals of 2019-nCoV infected pneumonia management, an evidence-based guideline urgently needs to be developed. Therefore, we drafted this guideline according to the rapid advice guidelines methodology and general rules of WHO guideline development; we also added the first-hand management data of Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University. This guideline includes the guideline methodology, epidemiological characteristics, disease screening and population prevention, diagnosis, treatment and control (including traditional Chinese Medicine), nosocomial infection prevention and control, and disease nursing of the 2019-nCoV. Moreover, we also provide a whole process of a successful treatment case of the severe 2019-nCoV infected pneumonia and experience and lessons of hospital rescue for 2019-nCoV infections. This rapid advice guideline is suitable for the first frontline doctors and nurses, managers of hospitals and healthcare sections, community residents, public health persons, relevant researchers, and all person who are interested in the 2019-nCoV.	7	1	4	10.1186/s40779-020-0233-6	Jin;Cai;Cheng;Cheng;Deng;Fan;Fang;Huang;Huang;Huang;Han;Hu;Hu;Li;Li;Liang;Lin;Luo;Ma;Ma;Peng;Pan;Pan;Ren;Sun;Wang;Wang;Weng;Wei;Wu;Xia;Xiong;Xu;Yao;Yuan;Ye;Zhang;Zhang;Zhang;Zhang;Zhao;Zhao;Zi;Zeng;Wang;Wang	Ying-Hui;Lin;Zhen-Shun;Hong;Tong;Yi-Pin;Cheng;Di;Lu-Qi;Qiao;Yong;Bo;Fen;Bing-Hui;Yi-Rong;Ke;Li-Kai;Li-Sha;Jing;Lin-Lu;Zhi-Yong;Yun-Bao;Zhen-Yu;Xue-Qun;Hui-Min;Ying;Yun-Yun;Hong;Chao-Jie;Dong-Fang;Jian;Yong;Hai-Bo;Xiao-Mei;Yu-Feng;Tai-Sheng;Xiao-Chun;Ying-Wen;Yin-Gao;Hua-Min;Yan;Ming-Juan;Hao;Xian-Tao;Yong-Yan;Xing-Huan	Center

There is a rising global concern for the recently emerged novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Full genomic sequences have been released by the worldwide scientific community in the last few weeks to understand the evolutionary origin and molecular characteristics of this virus. Taking advantage of all the genomic information currently available, we constructed a phylogenetic tree including also representatives of other coronaviridae, such as Bat coronavirus (BCoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome. We confirm high sequence similarity (>99%) between all sequenced 2019-nCoVs genomes available, with the closest BCoV sequence sharing 96.2% sequence identity, confirming the notion of a zoonotic origin of 2019-nCoV. Despite the low heterogeneity of the 2019-nCoV genomes, we could identify at least two hypervariable genomic hotspots, one of which is responsible for a Serine/Leucine variation in the viral ORF8-encoded protein. Finally, we perform a full proteomic comparison with other coronaviridae, identifying key aminoacidic differences to be considered for antiviral strategies deriving from previous anti-coronavirus approaches.	92	5	522-528	10.1002/jmv.25700	Ceraolo;Giorgi	Carmine;Federico M	Department of Pharmacy and Biotechnology, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.;Department of Pharmacy and Biotechnology, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.	eng	Cui J, Li F, Shi Z-L.

Virol.	1096-9071	Transmission dynamics and evolutionary history of 2019-nCoV.	To investigate the time origin, genetic diversity, and transmission dynamics of the recent 2019-nCoV outbreak in China and beyond, a total of 32 genomes of virus strains sampled from China, Thailand, and the USA with sampling dates between 24 December 2019 and 23 January 2020 were analyzed. Phylogenetic, transmission network, and likelihood-mapping analyses of the genome sequences were performed. On the basis of the likelihood-mapping analysis, the increasing tree-like signals (from 0% to 8.2%, 18.2%, and 25.4%) over time may be indicative of increasing genetic diversity of 2019-nCoV in human hosts. We identified three phylogenetic clusters using the Bayesian inference framework and three transmission clusters using transmission network analysis, with only one cluster identified by both methods using the above genome sequences of 2019-nCoV strains. The estimated mean evolutionary rate for 2019-nCoV ranged from 1.7926 × 10	92	5	501-511	10.1002/jmv.25701	Li;Wang;Zhao;Zai;Zhao;Li;Chaillon	Xingguang;Wei;Xiaofang;Junjie;Qiang;Yi;Antoine	Hubei Engineering Research Center of Viral Vector, Wuhan University of Bioengineering, Wuhan, China.;Department of Spleen and Stomach Diseases, First Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi University of Chinese Medicine, Nanning, China.;Department of Science and Technology, Ruikang Hospital Affiliated to Guangxi University of Chinese Medicine, Nanning, China.;Immunology Innovation Team, School of Medicine, Ningbo University, Ningbo, China.;Precision Cancer Center Airport Center, Tianjin Cancer Hospital Airport Hospital, Tianjin, China.;Hubei Engineering Research Center of Viral Vector, Wuhan University of Bioengineering, Wuhan, China.;Department of Medicine, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, California.	eng	Chan JFW, Yuan S, Kok KH, et al.

With the current trajectory of the 2019-nCoV outbreak unknown, public health and medicinal measures will both be needed to contain spreading of the virus and to optimize patient outcomes. Although little is known about the virus, an examination of the genome sequence shows strong homology with its better-studied cousin, SARS-CoV. The spike protein used for host cell infection shows key nonsynonymous mutations that might hamper the efficacy of previously developed therapeutics but remains a viable target for the development of biologics and macrocyclic peptides. Other key drug targets, including RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and coronavirus main proteinase (3CLpro), share a strikingly high (>95 %) homology to SARS-CoV. Herein, we suggest four potential drug candidates (an ACE2-based peptide, remdesivir, 3CLpro-1 and a novel vinylsulfone protease inhibitor) that could be used to treat patients suffering with the 2019-nCoV. We also summarize previous efforts into drugging these targets and hope to help in the development of broad-spectrum anti-coronaviral agents for future epidemics.	21	5	730-738	10.1002/cbic.202000047	Morse;Lalonde;Xu;Liu	Jared S;Tyler;Shiqing;Wenshe Ray	The Texas A&M Drug Discovery Laboratory, Department of Chemistry, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX, 77843, USA.;The Texas A&M Drug Discovery Laboratory, Department of Chemistry, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX, 77843, USA.;The Texas A&M Drug Discovery Laboratory, Department of Chemistry, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX, 77843, USA.;The Texas A&M Drug Discovery Laboratory, Department of Chemistry, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX, 77843, USA.	eng	P.

Virol.	1096-9071	Immunoinformatics-aided identification of T cell and B cell epitopes in the surface glycoprotein of 2019-nCoV.	The 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak has caused a large number of deaths with thousands of confirmed cases worldwide, especially in East Asia. This study took an immunoinformatics approach to identify significant cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) and B cell epitopes in the 2019-nCoV surface glycoprotein. Also, interactions between identified CTL epitopes and their corresponding major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I supertype representatives prevalent in China were studied by molecular dynamics simulations. We identified five CTL epitopes, three sequential B cell epitopes and five discontinuous B cell epitopes in the viral surface glycoprotein. Also, during simulations, the CTL epitopes were observed to be binding MHC class I peptide-binding grooves via multiple contacts, with continuous hydrogen bonds and salt bridge anchors, indicating their potential in generating immune responses. Some of these identified epitopes can be potential candidates for the development of 2019-nCoV vaccines.	92	5	495-500	10.1002/jmv.25698	Baruah;Bose	Vargab;Sujoy	Department of Biotechnology, Gauhati University, Guwahati, Assam, India.;Department of Biotechnology, Gauhati University, Guwahati, Assam, India.	eng	World Health Organization.

150	32022275	2020	05			Print-Electronic	Journal Article	Journal of medical virology	J. Med. Virol.	1096-9071	The first two cases of 2019-nCoV in Italy: Where they come from?	A novel Coronavirus, 2019-nCoV, has been identified as the causal pathogen of an ongoing epidemic, with the first cases reported in Wuhan, China, last December 2019, and has since spread to other countries worldwide, included Europe and very recently Italy. In this short report, phylogenetic reconstruction was used to better understand the transmission dynamics of the virus from its first introduction in China focusing on the more recent evidence of infection in a couple of Chinese tourists arrived in Italy on 23rd January 2020 and labeled as Coronavirus Italian cases. A maximum clade credibility tree has been built using a dataset of 54 genome sequences of 2019-nCoV plus two closely related bat strains (SARS-like CoV) available in GenBank. Bayesian time-scaled phylogenetic analysis was implemented in BEAST 1.10.4. The Bayesian phylogenetic reconstruction showed that 2019-2020 nCoV firstly introduced in Wuhan on 25 November 2019, started epidemic transmission reaching many countries worldwide, including Europe and Italy where the two strains isolated dated back 19 January 2020, the same that the Chinese tourists arrived in Italy. Strains isolated outside China were intermixed with strains isolated in China as evidence of likely imported cases in Rome, Italy, and Europe, as well. In conclusion, this report suggests that further spread of 2019-nCoV epidemic was supported by human mobility and that quarantine of suspected or diagnosed cases is useful to prevent further transmission. Viral genome phylogenetic analysis represents a useful tool for the evaluation of transmission dynamics and preventive action.	92	5	518-521	10.1002/jmv.25699	Giovanetti;Benvenuto;Angeletti;Ciccozzi	Marta;Domenico;Silvia;Massimo	Laboratório de Flavivírus, Instituto Oswaldo Cruz, Fundação Oswaldo Cruz, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.;Unit of Medical Statistics and Molecular Epidemiology, University Campus Bio-Medico of Rome, Rome, Italy.;Unit of Clinical Laboratory Science, University Campus Bio-Medico of Rome, Rome, Italy.;Unit of Medical Statistics and Molecular Epidemiology, University Campus Bio-Medico of Rome, Rome, Italy.	eng	Zhu N, Zhang D, Wang W, et al.

151	32020836	2020	Dec			Print	Case Reports;Journal Article	Emerging microbes & infections	Emerg Microbes Infect	2222-1751	RNA based mNGS approach identifies a novel human coronavirus from two individual pneumonia cases in 2019 Wuhan outbreak.	From December 2019, an outbreak of unusual pneumonia was reported in Wuhan with many cases linked to Huanan Seafood Market that sells seafood as well as live exotic animals. We investigated two patients who developed acute respiratory syndromes after independent contact history with this market. The two patients shared common clinical features including fever, cough, and multiple ground-glass opacities in the bilateral lung field with patchy infiltration. Here, we highlight the use of a low-input metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) approach on RNA extracted from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). It rapidly identified a novel coronavirus (named 2019-nCoV according to World Health Organization announcement) which was the sole pathogens in the sample with very high abundance level (1.5% and 0.62% of total RNA sequenced). The entire viral genome is 29,881 nt in length (GenBank MN988668 and MN988669, Sequence Read Archive database Bioproject accession PRJNA601736) and is classified into β-coronavirus genus. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that 2019-nCoV is close to coronaviruses (CoVs) circulating in Rhinolophus (Horseshoe bats), such as 98.7% nucleotide identity to partial RdRp gene of bat coronavirus strain BtCoV/4991 (GenBank KP876546, 370 nt sequence of RdRp and lack of other genome sequence) and 87.9% nucleotide identity to bat coronavirus strain bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21. Evolutionary analysis based on ORF1a/1b, S, and N genes also suggests 2019-nCoV is more likely a novel CoV independently introduced from animals to humans.	9	1	313-319	10.1080/22221751.2020.1725399	Chen;Liu;Zhang;Xu;Ye;Wu;Sun;Liu;Wu;Zhong;Mei;Zhang;Chen;Li;Shi;Lan;Liu	Liangjun;Weiyong;Qi;Ke;Guangming;Weichen;Ziyong;Fang;Kailang;Bo;Yi;Wenxia;Yu;Yirong;Mang;Ke;Yingle	State Key Laboratory of Virology, Modern Virology Research Center, College of Life Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan, People's Republic of China.;Department of Laboratory Medicine, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, People's Republic of China.;Department of Laboratory Medicine, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, People's Republic of China.;State Key Laboratory of Virology, Modern Virology Research Center, College of Life Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan, People's Republic of China.;State Key Laboratory of Virology, Modern Virology Research Center, College of Life Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan, People's Republic of China.;Department of Laboratory Medicine, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, People's Republic of China.;School of Medicine, Sun yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, People's Republic of China.;Department of Laboratory Medicine, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, People's Republic of China.;State Key Laboratory of Virology, Modern Virology Research Center, College of Life Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan, People's Republic of China.;State Key Laboratory of Virology, Modern Virology Research Center, College of Life Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan, People's Republic of China.;State Key Laboratory of Virology, Modern Virology Research Center, College of Life Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan, People's Republic of China.;State Key Laboratory of Virology, Modern Virology Research Center, College of Life Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan, People's Republic of China.;State Key Laboratory of Virology, Modern Virology Research Center, College of Life Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan, People's Republic of China.;State Key Laboratory of Virology, Modern Virology Research Center, College of Life Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan, People's Republic of China.;Department of Laboratory Medicine, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, People's Republic of China.;School of Medicine, Sun yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, People's Republic of China.;State Key Laboratory of Virology, Modern Virology Research Center, College of Life Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan, People's Republic of China.;State Key Laboratory of Virology, Modern Virology Research Center, College of Life Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan, People's Republic of China.	eng	Emerg Microbes Infect. 2020 Dec;9(1):275-277;Emerg Microbes Infect. 2020 Dec;9(1):221-236;Bioinformatics. 2015 May 15;31(10):1674-6;PLoS Pathog. 2017 Nov 30;13(11):e1006698;J Virol. 1999 Jan;73(1):152-60;Virus Res. 2018 Jan 2;243:83-90;Nat Methods. 2015 Oct;12(10):902-3;Nat Methods. 2015 Jan;12(1):59-60;Nat Med. 2015 Dec;21(12):1508-13;J Virol. 2017 Aug 10;91(17):;Syst Biol. 2010 May;59(3):307-21;Annu Rev Pathol. 2019 Jan 24;14:319-338	MEDLINE	ppublish

In late December, 2019, patients presenting with viral pneumonia due to an unidentified microbial agent were reported in Wuhan, China. A novel coronavirus was subsequently identified as the causative pathogen, provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). As of Jan 26, 2020, more than 2000 cases of 2019-nCoV infection have been confirmed, most of which involved people living in or visiting Wuhan, and human-to-human transmission has been confirmed.;We did next-generation sequencing of samples from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and cultured isolates from nine inpatients, eight of whom had visited the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan. Complete and partial 2019-nCoV genome sequences were obtained from these individuals. Viral contigs were connected using Sanger sequencing to obtain the full-length genomes, with the terminal regions determined by rapid amplification of cDNA ends. Phylogenetic analysis of these 2019-nCoV genomes and those of other coronaviruses was used to determine the evolutionary history of the virus and help infer its likely origin. Homology modelling was done to explore the likely receptor-binding properties of the virus.;The ten genome sequences of 2019-nCoV obtained from the nine patients were extremely similar, exhibiting more than 99·98% sequence identity. Notably, 2019-nCoV was closely related (with 88% identity) to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, collected in 2018 in Zhoushan, eastern China, but were more distant from SARS-CoV (about 79%) and MERS-CoV (about 50%). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 2019-nCoV fell within the subgenus Sarbecovirus of the genus Betacoronavirus, with a relatively long branch length to its closest relatives bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, and was genetically distinct from SARS-CoV. Notably, homology modelling revealed that 2019-nCoV had a similar receptor-binding domain structure to that of SARS-CoV, despite amino acid variation at some key residues.;2019-nCoV is sufficiently divergent from SARS-CoV to be considered a new human-infecting betacoronavirus. Although our phylogenetic analysis suggests that bats might be the original host of this virus, an animal sold at the seafood market in Wuhan might represent an intermediate host facilitating the emergence of the virus in humans. Importantly, structural analysis suggests that 2019-nCoV might be able to bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor in humans. The future evolution, adaptation, and spread of this virus warrant urgent investigation.;National Key Research and Development Program of China, National Major Project for Control and Prevention of Infectious Disease in China, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shandong First Medical University.	395	10224	565-574	10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30251-8	Lu;Zhao;Li;Niu;Yang;Wu;Wang;Song;Huang;Zhu;Bi;Ma;Zhan;Wang;Hu;Zhou;Hu;Zhou;Zhao;Chen;Meng;Wang;Lin;Yuan;Xie;Ma;Liu;Wang;Xu;Holmes;Gao;Wu;Chen;Shi;Tan	Roujian;Xiang;Juan;Peihua;Bo;Honglong;Wenling;Hao;Baoying;Na;Yuhai;Xuejun;Faxian;Liang;Tao;Hong;Zhenhong;Weimin;Li;Jing;Yao;Ji;Yang;Jianying;Zhihao;Jinmin;William J;Dayan;Wenbo;Edward C;George F;Guizhen;Weijun;Weifeng;Wenjie	NHC Key Laboratory of Biosafety, National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Beijing, China.;NHC Key Laboratory of Biosafety, National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Beijing, China.;Key Laboratory of Etiology and Epidemiology of Emerging Infectious Diseases in Universities of Shandong, Shandong First Medical University and Shandong Academy of Medical Sciences, Tai'an, China.;NHC Key Laboratory of Biosafety, National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Beijing, China.;Division for Viral Disease Detection, Hubei Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Wuhan, China.;BGI PathoGenesis Pharmaceutical Technology, Shenzhen, China.;NHC Key Laboratory of Biosafety, National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Beijing, China.;Research Network of Immunity and Health (RNIH), Beijing Institutes of Life Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.;NHC Key Laboratory of Biosafety, National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Beijing, China.;NHC Key Laboratory of Biosafety, National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Beijing, China.;Chinese Academy of Sciences Key Laboratory of Pathogenic Microbiology and Immunology, Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China;

Evol.	1567-7257	Full-genome evolutionary analysis of the novel corona virus (2019-nCoV) rejects the hypothesis of emergence as a result of a recent recombination event.	A novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) associated with human to human transmission and severe human infection has been recently reported from the city of Wuhan in China. Our objectives were to characterize the genetic relationships of the 2019-nCoV and to search for putative recombination within the subgenus of sarbecovirus.;Putative recombination was investigated by RDP4 and Simplot v3.5.1 and discordant phylogenetic clustering in individual genomic fragments was confirmed by phylogenetic analysis using maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods.;Our analysis suggests that the 2019-nCoV although closely related to BatCoV RaTG13 sequence throughout the genome (sequence similarity 96.3%), shows discordant clustering with the Bat_SARS-like coronavirus sequences. Specifically, in the 5'-part spanning the first 11,498 nucleotides and the last 3'-part spanning 24,341-30,696 positions, 2019-nCoV and RaTG13 formed a single cluster with Bat_SARS-like coronavirus sequences, whereas in the middle region spanning the 3'-end of ORF1a, the ORF1b and almost half of the spike regions, 2019-nCoV and RaTG13 grouped in a separate distant lineage within the sarbecovirus branch.;The levels of genetic similarity between the 2019-nCoV and RaTG13 suggest that the latter does not provide the exact variant that caused the outbreak in humans, but the hypothesis that 2019-nCoV has originated from bats is very likely. We show evidence that the novel coronavirus (2019-nCov) is not-mosaic consisting in almost half of its genome of a distinct lineage within the betacoronavirus. These genomic features and their potential association with virus characteristics and virulence in humans need further attention.	79		104212	10.1016/j.meegid.2020.104212	Paraskevis;Kostaki;Magiorkinis;Panayiotakopoulos;Sourvinos;Tsiodras	D;E G;G;G;G;S	Department of Hygiene Epidemiology and Medical Statistics, Medical School, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Athens, Greece.

Virol.	1096-9071	Potential of large "first generation" human-to-human transmission of 2019-nCoV.	To investigate the genetic diversity, time origin, and evolutionary history of the 2019-nCoV outbreak in China and Thailand, a total of 12 genome sequences of the virus with known sampling date (24 December 2019 and 13 January 2020) and geographic location (primarily Wuhan city, Hubei Province, China, but also Bangkok, Thailand) were analyzed. Phylogenetic and likelihood-mapping analyses of these genome sequences were performed. On the basis of our results, the star-like signal and topology of 2019-nCoV may be indicative of potentially large "first generation" human-to-human virus transmission. We estimated that 2019-nCoV likely originated in Wuhan on 9 November 2019 (95% credible interval: 25 September 2019 and 19 December 2019), and that Wuhan is the major hub for the spread of the 2019-nCoV outbreak in China and elsewhere. Our results could be useful for designing effective prevention strategies for 2019-nCoV in China and beyond.	92	4	448-454	10.1002/jmv.25693	Li;Zai;Wang;Li	Xingguang;Junjie;Xiaomei;Yi	Hubei Engineering Research Center of Viral Vector, Wuhan University of Bioengineering, Wuhan, China.;Immunology Innovation Team, School of Medicine, Ningbo University, Ningbo, China.;Hubei Engineering Research Center of Viral Vector, Wuhan University of Bioengineering, Wuhan, China.;Hubei Engineering Research Center of Viral Vector, Wuhan University of Bioengineering, Wuhan, China.	eng	Drosten C, Günther S, Preiser W, et al.

As of January 22, 2020, a total of 571 cases of the 2019-new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) have been reported in 25 provinces (districts and cities) in China. At present, there is no vaccine or antiviral treatment for human and animal coronavirus, so that identifying the drug treatment options as soon as possible is critical for the response to the 2019-nCoV outbreak. Three general methods, which include existing broad-spectrum antiviral drugs using standard assays, screening of a chemical library containing many existing compounds or databases, and the redevelopment of new specific drugs based on the genome and biophysical understanding of individual coronaviruses, are used to discover the potential antiviral treatment of human pathogen coronavirus. Lopinavir /Ritonavir, Nucleoside analogues, Neuraminidase inhibitors, Remdesivir, peptide (EK1), abidol, RNA synthesis inhibitors (such as TDF, 3TC), anti-inflammatory drugs (such as hormones and other molecules), Chinese traditional medicine, such ShuFengJieDu Capsules and Lianhuaqingwen Capsule, could be the drug treatment options for 2019-nCoV. However, the efficacy and safety of these drugs for 2019- nCoV still need to be further confirmed by clinical experiments.	14	1	69-71	10.5582/bst.2020.01020	Lu	Hongzhou	Scientific Research Center, Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.;Department of Infectious Diseases, Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.;Department of Infectious Disease, Huashan Hospital Affiliated to Fudan University, Shanghai, China.	eng		MEDLINE	ppublish

There is a worldwide concern about the new coronavirus 2019-nCoV as a global public health threat. In this article, we provide a preliminary evolutionary and molecular epidemiological analysis of this new virus. A phylogenetic tree has been built using the 15 available whole genome sequences of 2019-nCoV, 12 whole genome sequences of 2019-nCoV, and 12 highly similar whole genome sequences available in gene bank (five from the severe acute respiratory syndrome, two from Middle East respiratory syndrome, and five from bat SARS-like coronavirus). Fast unconstrained Bayesian approximation analysis shows that the nucleocapsid and the spike glycoprotein have some sites under positive pressure, whereas homology modeling revealed some molecular and structural differences between the viruses. The phylogenetic tree showed that 2019-nCoV significantly clustered with bat SARS-like coronavirus sequence isolated in 2015, whereas structural analysis revealed mutation in Spike Glycoprotein and nucleocapsid protein. From these results, the new 2019-nCoV is distinct from SARS virus, probably trasmitted from bats after mutation conferring ability to infect humans.	92	4	455-459	10.1002/jmv.25688	Benvenuto;Giovanetti;Ciccozzi;Spoto;Angeletti;Ciccozzi	Domenico;Marta;Alessandra;Silvia;Silvia;Massimo	Unit of Medical Statistics and Molecular Epidemiology, University Campus Bio-Medico of Rome, Rome, Italy.;Laboratório de Flavivírus, Instituto Oswaldo Cruz, Fundação Oswaldo Cruz, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.;Unit of Medical Statistics and Molecular Epidemiology, University Campus Bio-Medico of Rome, Rome, Italy.;Internal Medicine Unit, University Campus Bio-Medico of Rome, Rome, Italy.;Unit of Clinical Laboratory Science, University Campus Bio-Medico of Rome, Rome, Italy.;Laboratório de Flavivírus, Instituto Oswaldo Cruz, Fundação Oswaldo Cruz, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.	eng	Drosten C, Günther S, Preiser W, et al.

A mysterious outbreak of atypical pneumonia in late 2019 was traced to a seafood wholesale market in Wuhan of China. Within a few weeks, a novel coronavirus tentatively named as 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was announced by the World Health Organization. We performed bioinformatics analysis on a virus genome from a patient with 2019-nCoV infection and compared it with other related coronavirus genomes. Overall, the genome of 2019-nCoV has 89% nucleotide identity with bat SARS-like-CoVZXC21 and 82% with that of human SARS-CoV. The phylogenetic trees of their orf1a/b, Spike, Envelope, Membrane and Nucleoprotein also clustered closely with those of the bat, civet and human SARS coronaviruses. However, the external subdomain of Spike's receptor binding domain of 2019-nCoV shares only 40% amino acid identity with other SARS-related coronaviruses. Remarkably, its orf3b encodes a completely novel short protein. Furthermore, its new orf8 likely encodes a secreted protein with an alpha-helix, following with a beta-sheet(s) containing six strands. Learning from the roles of civet in SARS and camel in MERS, hunting for the animal source of 2019-nCoV and its more ancestral virus would be important for understanding the origin and evolution of this novel lineage B	9	1	221-236	10.1080/22221751.2020.1719902	Chan;Kok;Zhu;Chu;To;Yuan;Yuen	Jasper Fuk-Woo;Kin-Hang;Zheng;Hin;Kelvin Kai-Wang;Shuofeng;Kwok-Yung	State Key Laboratory of Emerging Infectious Diseases, The University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China.;Department of Clinical Microbiology and Infection Control, The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen, Guangdong, People's Republic of China.;Department of Microbiology, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China.;Carol Yu Centre for Infection, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China.;State Key Laboratory of Emerging Infectious Diseases, The University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China.;Department of Microbiology, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China.;Carol Yu Centre for Infection, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China.;Department of Microbiology, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China.;State Key Laboratory of Emerging Infectious Diseases, The University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China.;Department of Microbiology, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China.;Carol Yu Centre for Infection, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China.;State Key Laboratory of Emerging Infectious Diseases, The University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China.;Department of Clinical Microbiology and Infection Control, The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen, Guangdong, People's Republic of China.;Department of Microbiology, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China.;Carol Yu Centre for Infection, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China.;State Key Laboratory of Emerging Infectious Diseases, The University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China.;Department of Microbiology, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China.;Carol Yu Centre for Infection, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China.;Department of Clinical Microbiology and Infection Control, The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen, Guangdong, People's Republic of China.;Department of Microbiology, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China.;Carol Yu Centre for Infection, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China.	eng		MEDLINE	ppublish

An ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with a novel coronavirus was reported in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China. Affected patients were geographically linked with a local wet market as a potential source. No data on person-to-person or nosocomial transmission have been published to date.;In this study, we report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and microbiological findings of five patients in a family cluster who presented with unexplained pneumonia after returning to Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China, after a visit to Wuhan, and an additional family member who did not travel to Wuhan. Phylogenetic analysis of genetic sequences from these patients were done.;From Jan 10, 2020, we enrolled a family of six patients who travelled to Wuhan from Shenzhen between Dec 29, 2019 and Jan 4, 2020. Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus. Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members. None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital. Five family members (aged 36-66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3-6 days after exposure. They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6-10 days after symptom onset. They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities. Older patients (aged >60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels. The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats.;Our findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.;The Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Seak-Kan Tong, Respiratory Viral Research Foundation Limited, Hui Ming, Hui Hoy and Chow Sin Lan Charity Fund Limited, Marina Man-Wai Lee, the Hong Kong Hainan Commercial Association South China Microbiology Research Fund, Sanming Project of Medicine (Shenzhen), and High Level-Hospital Program (Guangdong Health Commission).	395	10223	514-523	10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30154-9	Chan;Yuan;Kok;To;Chu;Yang;Xing;Liu;Yip;Poon;Tsoi;Lo;Chan;Poon;Chan;Ip;Cai;Cheng;Chen;Hui;Yuen	Jasper Fuk-Woo;Shuofeng;Kin-Hang;Kelvin Kai-Wang;Hin;Jin;Fanfan;Jieling;Cyril Chik-Yan;Rosana Wing-Shan;Hoi-Wah;Simon Kam-Fai;Kwok-Hung;Vincent Kwok-Man;Wan-Mui;Jonathan Daniel;Jian-Piao;Vincent Chi-Chung;Honglin;Christopher Kim-Ming;Kwok-Yung	State Key Laboratory of Emerging Infectious Diseases, Carol Yu Centre for Infection, Department of Microbiology, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China;

Different from both MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, 2019-nCoV is the seventh member of the family of coronaviruses that infect humans. Enhanced surveillance and further investigation are ongoing.

The recent emergence of a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), which is causing an outbreak of unusual viral pneumonia in patients in Wuhan, a central city in China, is another warning of the risk of CoVs posed to public health. In this minireview, we provide a brief introduction of the general features of CoVs and describe diseases caused by different CoVs in humans and animals. This review will help understand the biology and potential risk of CoVs that exist in richness in wildlife such as bats.	92	4	418-423	10.1002/jmv.25681	Chen;Liu;Guo	Yu;Qianyun;Deyin	State Key Laboratory of Virology, Modern Virology Research Center, College of Life Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.;State Key Laboratory of Virology, Modern Virology Research Center, College of Life Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.;Center for Infection and Immunity Study, School of Medicine, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.	eng	Wang LF, Shi Z, Zhang S, Field H, Daszak P, Eaton B.

Virol.	1096-9071	Cross-species transmission of the newly identified coronavirus 2019-nCoV.	The current outbreak of viral pneumonia in the city of Wuhan, China, was caused by a novel coronavirus designated 2019-nCoV by the World Health Organization, as determined by sequencing the viral RNA genome. Many initial patients were exposed to wildlife animals at the Huanan seafood wholesale market, where poultry, snake, bats, and other farm animals were also sold. To investigate possible virus reservoir, we have carried out comprehensive sequence analysis and comparison in conjunction with relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) bias among different animal species based on the 2019-nCoV sequence. Results obtained from our analyses suggest that the 2019-nCoV may appear to be a recombinant virus between the bat coronavirus and an origin-unknown coronavirus. The recombination may occurred within the viral spike glycoprotein, which recognizes a cell surface receptor. Additionally, our findings suggest that 2019-nCoV has most similar genetic information with bat coronovirus and most similar codon usage bias with snake. Taken together, our results suggest that homologous recombination may occur and contribute to the 2019-nCoV cross-species transmission.	92	4	433-440	10.1002/jmv.25682	Ji;Wang;Zhao;Zai;Li	Wei;Wei;Xiaofang;Junjie;Xingguang	Department of Microbiology, Peking University Health Science Center School of Basic Medical Sciences, Beijing, China.;Department of Spleen and Stomach Diseases, The First affiliated Hospital of Guangxi University of Chinese Medicine, Nanning, China.;Department of Science and Technology, Ruikang Hospital Affiliated to Guangxi University of Chinese Medicine, Nanning, China.;Immunology Innovation Team, School of Medicine, Ningbo University, Ningbo, China.;Hubei Engineering Research Center of Viral Vector, Wuhan University of Bioengineering, Wuhan, China.	eng	Chan PK.
