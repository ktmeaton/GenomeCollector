1	595915	PRJNA595915	raw sequence reads	An important problem in evolution is identifying the genetic basis of how different species adapt to similar environments. Understanding how diverse bacterial pathogens evolve in response to an antimicrobial treatment is a pressing example of this problem, where discovery of molecular parallelism could lead to clinically useful predictions. Evolution experiments with pathogens in environments containing antibiotics, combined with periodic whole population genome sequencing, can be used to identify many contending routes to antimicrobial resistance. We separately propagated two clinically relevant Gram-negative pathogens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii, in increasing concentrations of tobramycin in two different environments each: planktonic and biofilm. Independent of the pathogen, populations adapted to tobramycin selection by parallel evolution of mutations in fusA1, encoding elongation factor G, and ptsP, encoding phosphoenolpyruvate phosphotransferase. As neither gene is a direct target of this aminoglycoside, both are unexpected and underreported causes of resistance. Additionally, both species acquired antibiotic-associated mutations that were more prevalent in the biofilm lifestyle than planktonic, in electron transport chain components in A. baumannii and LPS biosynthesis enzymes in P. aeruginosa populations. Using existing databases, we discovered both fusA1 and ptsP mutations to be prevalent in antibiotic resistant clinical isolates. Additionally, we report site-specific parallelism of fusA1 mutations that extend across several bacterial phyla. This study suggests that strong selective pressures such as antibiotic treatment may result in high levels of predictability in molecular targets of evolution despite differences between organism's genetic background and environment.	eSequencing		eWhole	eGenome	eMultispecies	Parallel evolution of tobramycin resistance across species and environments;Molecular Microbial Persistence and Pathogenesis;Predicting the emergence of antibiotic resistance through multi-omics approaches and Immune System-surveillan						2019-12-16		2019-12-16		University of Pittsburgh

11	587346	PRJEB34503	Other	Upon infection of their host, temperate phages (viruses that infect bacteria) enter either the lytic or the lysogenic cycle, causing host lysis and horizontal transmission or dormancy and vertical transmission, respectively. Co-culture experiments of bacteria and obligately killing temperate phage mutants - that are locked in the lytic cycle - have provided key insights into the evolutionary dynamics of CRISPR-Cas and phage interactions, but ignore this dichotomy of temperate phage transmission strategies. Here we show that type I CRISPR-Cas immune systems are much less efficient in clearing wildtype temperate phage infections from the bacterial population than phage mutants locked in the lytic cycle, and are in fact maladaptive to the host due to severe immunopathological effects that specifically manifest during vertical transmission of the phage. These fitness costs drive the loss of CRISPR-Cas from bacterial populations, unless the phage carries anti-CRISPR (acr) genes that suppress the immune system of the host. The opposing fitness consequences of CRISPR-Cas in the face of horizontally and vertically transmitting phages can therefore help to explain the frequent loss and gain of CRISPR-Cas immune systems across bacterial strains, and highlight the strong selective benefits of phage-encoded acr genes during long-lived infections associated with vertical transmission.	eSequencing	Evolutionary loss of CRISPR-Cas	eWhole	eGenome	eMonoisolate	Mixed mode transmission of phages drives loss of Type I CRISPR-Cas immune systems from bacteria						2019-11-03		2019-11-03		UNIVERSITY OF EXETER

The goals of this study are to compare transcriptome profiling of control of P. aeruginosa PAO1 (RNA-seq) to transcriptome profiling of farnesol-treated P. aeruginosa PAO1 and to evaluate protocols for optimal high-throughput data analysis. Methods:LB medium (50 mL) was inoculated with exponential growth phase P. aeruginosa PAO1 at a concentration of 108 CFU/mL. Farnesol was then added at a concentration of either 0 (control) or 0.56 mg/mL, in triplicate. All six experiment groups were incubated in a water bath shaker at 37 ºC with a shaking rate of 180 rpm for 5 h. Cells were then sampled and centrifuged from the three control groups and three farnesol treatment groups, respectively. The cell precipitates were separately snap-frozen at -80ºC. Total RNA was isolated from cells using Trizol (Life Technologies, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Results: Our RNA-seq results showed that less than 100 genes of P. aeruginosa PAO1 were differentially expressed following farnesol treatment. We found that about 1.7% of all detected genes (96 of 5554 genes) were more than two-fold differentially expressed following farnesol treatment. Conclusions: Overall design: The mRNA profiles of P. aeruginosa PAO1 (ck) and farnesol-treated P. aeruginosa PAO1 (sample1) were generated by deep sequencing, in triplicate, using Illumina Hiseq 2000.	eSequencing	Next Generation Sequencing Facilitates Quantitative Analysis of control of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 and farnesol-treated P. aeruginosa PAO1 Transcriptomes	eWhole	eTranscriptome	eMultiisolate	Next Generation Sequencing Facilitates Quantitative Analysis of control of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 and farnesol-treated P. aeruginosa PAO1 Transcriptomes			208964	287	eBacteria	2019-10-10		2019-10-11		Guangdong Institute of Microbiology

22	575384	PRJEB16535	Genome sequencing and assembly	Pseudomonas aeruginosa is one of the most relevant oportunistic human pathogens. This bacterium has an extraordinary capacity for developing resistance to most of the available antipseudomonal antibiotics, including carbapenems, through the selection of mutations in various chromosomal genes such as oprD, ampC or several efflux systems. Previous studies have shown that there is a number of genes related to central metabolic functions which also play a role in antimicrobial resistance. The aim of this study is to characterize the evolution of antibiotic resistance to carbapenems upon exposure to sub-inhibitory concentrations of such antimicrobial agents, as well as the fitness consequences and changes in virulence traits for the bacterium by comparing wild type populations with their derivative developed strains exposed to growing concentrations of imipenem during approximately 150 generations. Complete genome was carried out in order to gain a deeper understanding of the evolution of resistance to carbapenems in wild type susceptible strains and its impact on the fitness and virulence of P. aeruginosa.	eSequencing	Long exposure to sub-inhibitory concentration of carbapenems and its effect on the Pseudomonas aeruginosa fitness and virulence	eWhole	eGenome	eMonoisolate	Effect of carbapenems on the Pseudomonas aeruginosa fitness and virulence.						2019-10-02		2019-10-02		ERA7

45	562735	PRJNA562735	genome sequencing and assembly	Ceftazidime-avibactam (CZA) belongs to a new class of broad-spectrum beta lactam/beta lactamase inhibitor combinations designed to treat infections caused by multidrug resistant bacteria. Understanding the emergence of resistance to this important new drug class is of critical importance. Elevated mutational rates may facilitate the acquisition of antimicrobial resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains in the context of chronic infection. Whether P. aeruginosa hypermutation can also play a role in acute infection remains unclear. In this work, we demonstrate that evolved mismatch repair deficiency in P. aeruginosa, an important pathogen responsible for significant morbidity and mortality among hospitalized patients, may facilitate rapid acquisition of resistance to CZA in the context of acute infection.</p><p>Whole genome sequencing was performed on 9 serially-cultured blood and respiratory isolates from a patient in whom ceftazidime-avibactam (CZA) resistance emerged in vivo over the course of days. The CZA-resistant clone was differentiated by 14 mutations, including a gain-of-function G183D substitution in the PDC-5 chromosomal AmpC cephalosporinase conferring CZA resistance. This lineage also contained a substitution (R656H) at a conserved position in the ATPase domain of the MutS protein, and elevated mutational rates were confirmed by mutational accumulation experiments. In addition, adaptive evolution experiments demonstrated rapid acquisition of CZA-resistance in MMR-deficient strain compared with the isogenic wild type strain. Our results suggest a possibly underappreciated role for evolved MMR deficiency in facilitating rapid adaptive evolution of P. aeruginosa in the context of acute infection. These findings are relevant for both diagnosis and treatment of antimicrobial resistance emerging in acute infection in the hypermutator background, and additionally may have implications for the emergence of more virulent phenotypes.	eSequencing	Pseudomonas aeruginosa	eWhole	eGenome	eMultiisolate	Serial Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates from acute infection			287	287	eBacteria	2019-08-28		2019-08-28	yes	National Institute of Allergy and Infection Diseases

53	561332	PRJNA561332	Transcriptome or Gene expression	Bacterial small non-coding RNAs (sRNAs) play post-transcriptional regulatory roles in cellular responses to changing environmental cues and in adaptation to harsh conditions. Generally, the RNA-binding protein Hfq helps sRNAs associate with target mRNAs to modulate their translation and to modify global RNA pools depending on physiological state. Here, a combination of in vivo UV crosslinking immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing (CLIP-seq) and total RNA-seq showed that Hfq interacts with different regions of the P. aeruginosa transcriptome under planktonic versus biofilm conditions. In the present approach, P. aeruginosa Hfq preferentially interacted with repeats of the AAN triplet motif at mRNA 5’ UTRs and sRNAs, and U-rich sequences at rho-independent terminators. Further transcriptome analysis suggested that sRNAs association with Hfq is primarily a function of their expression levels, strongly supporting that the pool of Hfq-associated RNAs is equilibrated by RNA concentration-driven cycling on and off Hfq. Overall, our combinatorial CLIP-seq and total RNA-seq approach highlights conditional sRNA associations with Hfq as a novel aspect of post-transcriptional regulation in P. aeruginosa.

Overall design: To detect the binding sites for P. aeruginosa Hfq between different conditions we collected three biological replicates of P. aeruginosa PAO1 hfq::3xFLAG strain from planktonic (OD600 = 2.0) and biofilm (48 hour-old on LB agar). Half of each replicate culture was irradiated with UV light (254 nm, 800 mJ/cm2) (+XL), while the other half was left untreated (-XL). Bacteria were lysed and the FLAG-tagged protein was immunoprecipitated using a monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody. The samples were treated with benzonase nuclease, calf intestine phosphorylase, and polynucleotide kinase in the presence of radioactive gamma-ATP. Samples were separated with SDS-PAGE followed by transfer to nitrocellulose membranes. Radioactively labelled RNA-protein complexes were eluted from membranes and treated with Proteinase K. Purified RNA was used as input for library preparation using the NEB Next Small RNA Library kit. Besides, total RNA was purified from both planktonic and biofilm conditions and the high-throughput sequencing was performed at Core Unit Systems Medicine, University Hospital of Würzburg, Germany.	eSequencing	Conditional Hfq association with small non-coding RNAs in Pseudomonas aeruginosa revealed through comparative UV crosslinking immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing [RIP-Seq]	eWhole	eTranscriptome	eMultiisolate	Conditional Hfq association with small non-coding RNAs in Pseudomonas aeruginosa revealed through comparative UV crosslinking immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing [RIP-Seq]			287	287	eBacteria	2019-08-21		2019-11-15		Life Science and Medical Bioscience, Waseda University

These genomes contain over 625 million protein sequences used to generate the Unified Human Gastrointestinal Protein (UHGP) catalogue, a collection that more than doubles the number of gut protein clusters over the Integrated Gene Catalogue. We find that a large portion of the human gut microbiome remains to be fully explored, with over 70% of the UHGG species lacking cultured representatives, and 40% of the UHGP missing meaningful functional annotations. Intra-species genomic variation analyses revealed a large reservoir of accessory genes and single-nucleotide variants, many of which were specific to individual human populations.

63	556837	PRJEB32170	Genome sequencing and assembly	Objectives:Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a major bacterial pathogen responsible for hospital associated infections. Although its epidemiology is considered as non-clonal, some particular international high risk multidrug resistant clones have been recognized. From the first report of an intra-hospital outbreak due to a SHV2a producing P. aeruginosa strain, we described the emergence of a new ST235 specific lineage harboring this uncommon extended spectrum beta lactamase.Methods:Between May and October 2018, four patients hospitalized in the cardiovascular intensive care unit of a French teaching hospital were infected by a multidrug resistant P. aeruginosa isolate. Serotype and antimicrobial susceptibility were tested; MLST, core genome MLST and resistome were determined through whole genome sequencing. A phylogenetic analysis based on single nucleotide polymorphism was performed using available ST235 genomes. Results:The four strains were susceptible to colistin, ciprofloxacin, ceftazidime-avibactam and ceftolozane-tazobactam. blaSHV2a was identified in each genome of this ST235 - O11 serotype cluster that showed an identical cgMLST profile (0 to 2 out of 4162 different alleles). The phylogenic analysis of 164 ST235 genomes showed that only four other strains harbored a blaSHV2a, originating from France and USA, clustering together although being different than the outbreak strains. Conclusions:Among the ST235 P. aeruginosa strains, a sub-lineage sharing a common genetic background and harboring the blaSHV2a extended spectrum beta-lactamase seems to emerge from different locations, yielding secondary local outbreak.	eSequencing	Local outbreak of extended spectrum beta lactamase SHV2a producing Pseudomonas aeruginosa	eWhole	eGenome	eMonoisolate	Local outbreak of extended spectrum beta lactamase SHV2a producing Pseudomonas aeruginosa reveals the emergence of a new specific sub-lineage of the international ST235 high risk clone						2019-07-26		2019-07-26		Hopital Henri Mondor APHP

66	556370	PRJNA556370	Transcriptome or Gene expression	The Mobile CRISPRi system with and without mRFP-targeting sgRNA was engineered into Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA14 strain with chromosomally encoded mRFP. RNA was isolated from these strains, and the corresponding cDNA library was synthesized and sequenced in 150 bp paired-end reads. Approximately 1,000,000 reads were collected for each of the two samples, with ~94% alignment to PA14 WT by Bowtie254, and transcripts were counted with HTSeq55. Only genes with a non-normalized read count greater than 1 in both samples were included in analysis, with a coverage of 1286 genes (~20% genome). This data shows that the Mobile CRISPRi system is selective for sgRNA-guided knockdown of mRFP. Overall design: The RNA concentration for each sample was determined with a NanoDrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). 10 ng total RNA of each sample was fragmented for 6 min, cDNA libraries were prepared using “NEBNext Ultra RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina” (NEB#E7770S). Libraries were sequenced in collaboration with the Chan Zuckerberg Biohub in San Francisco on an Illumina MiSeq in 150 bp paired-end runs. Approximately 1,000,000 reads were collected for each of the two samples, with ~94% alignment to PA14 WT by Bowtie254, and transcripts were counted with HTSeq55.

77	554489	PRJEB32583	Other	Whole genome sequencing (WGS) is increasingly used to study bacterial outbreak epidemiology such as hospital-acquired Pseudomonas aeruginosa, although optimal single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) cut-off values for clonality are unknown. Weperformed in vitro subculture experiments of three clinical P. aeruginosa strains to define a SNP cut-off value. The dataset contains (A) three different generations of each strain, and (B)five different colonies of one generation of each strain.Additionally, SNP analysis was applied during a multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa (MDR-P) outbreak. Isolates were cultured from three patients and from environmental samples. Clonal relationship between patients and sink and shower drain isolates, with previous negativesurveillance cultures in two patients, and prior positive drain cultures, made acquisition of the MDR-P strain through transmission from drain to patient plausible. In conclusion, based on subculture experiments, we defined objective SNP cut-off values for our WGS pipeline to detect clonality of P. aeruginosa, and applied these during outbreak investigations.	eSequencing	Pseudomonas aeruginosa transmission from sink to patient	eWhole	eGenome	eMonoisolate	In vitro single nucleotide variability applied in vivo: drain to patient transmission of multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa						2019-07-14		2019-07-14		academisch medisch centrum

The dPTP is then removed and a random set of mutations are fixed via a further primer extension in the presence of only natural nucleotides. Finally, a targeted number of the mutagenized templates are replicated with PCR and used to make a short read sequencing library.

113	535434	PRJNA535434	Genome sequencing and assembly	The chronic colonisation of the respiratory tract by the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa is the primary cause of morbidity and mortality in Cystic Fibrosis (CF) patients. P. aeruginosa has been shown to undergo extensive genomic adaptation facilitating its persistence within the CF lung allowing it to evade the host immune response and outcompete co-colonisers within the lung microbiota. However, whilst several studies describe the mutations that frequently arise in clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa, the environmental factors governing the emergence of these genetic variants is less well characterised. Bile aspiration, a consequence of gastro-oesophageal reflux, has recently emerged as a major co-morbidity in CF. In order to investigate whether bile may select for genetic variants, P. aeruginosa was experimentally evolved in Artificial Sputum Medium, a synthetic media resembling environmental conditions found within the CF lung. Pigmented derivatives of P. aeruginosa emerged exclusively in the presence of bile with genome sequencing analysis identifying single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in quorum sensing (lasR) and both the pyocyanin (phzS) and pyomelanin (hmgA) pathways.	eSequencing	Pseudomonas aeruginosa	eWhole	eGenome	eMultiisolate	Pathoadaptive isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa			287	287	eBacteria	2019-04-25	2019-08-07T00:00:00Z	2019-04-25		University College Cork

122	531832	PRJNA531832	Transcriptome or Gene expression	Pseudomonas aeruginosa is one of the most common pathogens in hospital-acquired infection, which is tightly controlled by a multi-layered regulatory network including quorum sensing system (QS), type VI secretion system (T6SS) and resistance to host immunity. In the present study, we found that a PA3880 gene, which encodes an unknown protein, acted as a regulator of anaerobic metabolism, response to oxidative stress and virulence in P. aeruginosa. More than thirty PA3880 homologs were found in other bacterial genomes, indicating that PA3880 was widely distributed in bacterial kingdom with a conserved function. Deletion of PA3880 gene changed expression of more than seven hundred genes, including a group of virulence genes under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. To further study the mechanisms of PA3880-mediated regulation on virulence, we utilized bacterial two-hybrid assay and found that PA3880 protein directly interacted with QS regulator MvfR and anaerobic regulator Anr. Loss of PA3880 protein significantly blunted the pathogenicity of P. aeruginosa, resulting in increased survival, decreased bacterial burdens, muffled inflammatory response, and less lung injuries in mice. Mechanistically, we identified that Cys44 was a critical site for full function of PA3880 to influence alveolar macrophage phagocytosis and bacterial clearance. We also found that AnvM directly interacted with host receptors TLR2 and TLR5, which might lead to activation of host immune response. Hence, we named PA3880 as anvM (anaerobic and virulence modulator). The present characterization of anvM will help to uncover new targets and strategies to treat P. aeruginosa infections.

124	531635	PRJEB31965	Other	Acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL) quorum sensing (QS) controls expression of over 200 genes in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. There are two AHL regulatory systems, the LasR-LasI circuit, and the RhlR-RhlI system. We mapped transcription termination sites affected by AHL QS in P. aeruginosa and in doing so we identified AHL-regulated sRNAs. We focused on one particular sRNA in the rhlI locus. We found that rhlI, which encodes the enzyme that produces the AHL N-butanoyl-homoserine lactone (C4-HSL), is controlled by a 5’ UTR derived sRNA we name RhlS. We also identified an antisense RNA encoded opposite the rhlI start codon, which we name asRhlS. RhlS accumulates as wild-type cells enter stationary phase and it is required for production of normal levels of C4-HSL through activation of rhlI translation. RhlS also directly represses translation of at least one other unlinked gene, fpvA. The asRhlS is at maximal levels during logarithmic growth, and we suggest the asRhlS may be antagonistic to RhlS. The rhlI-encoded sRNAs represent a novel aspect of RNA-mediated tuning of P. aeruginosa QS.	eSequencing	A rhlI 5’ UTR-derived sRNA regulates RhlR-dependent quorum sensing in Pseudomonas aeruginosa	eWhole	eGenome	eMonoisolate	A rhlI 5’ UTR-derived sRNA regulates RhlR-dependent quorum sensing in Pseudomonas aeruginosa						2019-04-09		2019-04-09		WEIZMANN INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE
125	531246	PRJNA531246	raw sequence reads	Hfq is an RNA chaperone that serves as a master regulator of bacterial physiology. Here we show that in the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the loss of Hfq can result in a dramatic reduction in growth in a manner that is dependent upon MexT, a transcription regulator that governs antibiotic resistance in this organism. Using a combination of chromatin immunoprecipitation with high-throughput sequencing and transposon insertion sequencing we identify MexT-activated genes responsible for mediating the growth defect of hfq mutant cells. These include a newly identified MexT-controlled gene we call hilR. We demonstrate that hilR encodes a small protein that is acutely toxic to wild-type cells when produced ectopically. Furthermore, we show that hilR expression is negatively regulated by Hfq, offering a possible explanation for the growth defect of hfq mutant cells. Finally, we present evidence that the expression of MexT-activated genes is dependent upon GshA, an enzyme involved in the synthesis of glutathione. Our findings suggest that Hfq can influence the growth of P. aeruginosa by limiting the toxic effects of specific MexT-regulated genes. Moreover, our results identify glutathione as a factor important for the in vivo activity of MexT.	eSequencing		eWhole	eGenome	eMultispecies	Loss of RNA chaperone Hfq unveils a toxic pathway in Pseudomonas aeruginosa;Graduate Research Fellowship Program (GRFP);Control of fimbrial gene expression in Pseudomonas aeruginosa;An essential RNA chaperone in Pseudomonas aeruginosa						2019-04-06		2019-04-06	yes	Boston Children's Hospital

131	527991	PRJDB8046	Genome sequencing	In 2017, A total of 300 clinical isolates of carbapenem-resistance Pseudomonas aeruginosa were obtained in 47 prefectures in Japan. The presence of carbapenem resistant genes, including blaGESs, blaIMPs, and blaVIMs, were determined using PCR and sequence. Of them, 2 isolates harbored novel VIM-type Metallo-beta-Lactamase Variant, VIM-60. The 2 isolates were analyzed by next generation sequencer.	eSequencing	Pseudomonas aeruginosa	eWhole	eGenome	eMonoisolate	VIM-60 producing multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa in Japan			287	287	eBacteria	2019-03-12	2019-03-18T22:00:21Z	2019-03-19	yes	Microbiology, Juntendo University School of Medicine
132	527727	PRJNA527727	Other	Regulatory networks including virulence-related transcriptional factors (TFs) determine bacterial pathogenicity in response to different environmental cues. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a Gram-negative opportunistic pathogen of humans, recruits numerous TFs in quorum sensing (QS) system, type III secretion system (T3SS) and Type VI secretion system (T6SS) to mediate the pathogenicity. Although many virulence-related TFs have been illustrated individually, very little is known about their crosstalks and regulatory network. Here, based on chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) and transcriptome profiling (RNA-seq), we primarily focused on understanding the crosstalks of 20 virulence-related TFs, which led to construction of a virulence regulatory network named PAGnet (Pseudomonas aeruginosa Genomic integrated regulatory network), including 82 crosstalk targets. The PAGnet uncovered the intricate mechanism of virulence regulation and revealed master regulators in QS, T3SS and T6SS pathways. In particular, GacA and ExsA showed novel functions in QS and nitrogen metabolism. In addition, an online PAGnet platform was provided to analyze these TFs and more virulence factors. Taken together, the present study revealed the function-specific crosstalks of virulence regulatory network, which might provide new strategies for treating infections in P. aeruginosa in the future. Overall design: ChIP-seq and RNA-seq analyses of genomic regulators in Pseudomonas aeruginosa Please note that the processed data generated from both replicates is linked to the corresponding rep1 sample records.	eSequencing	ChIP-seq and RNA-seq analyses of genomic regulators in Pseudomonas aeruginosa	eWhole	eOther	eMultiisolate	ChIP-seq and RNA-seq analyses of genomic regulators in Pseudomonas aeruginosa			208964	287	eBacteria	2019-03-18		2019-07-16		Dr Xin DENG's Lab, Department of Biomedical Sciences, City University of Hong Kong	ePublished	2019-07-05T00:00:00Z	31270321	ePubmed

We aim to apply phage therapy in combination with antibiotics to treat P. aeruginosa PAO1. Therefore, lytic phage were isolated from influent collected from wastewater treatment plant using Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 as host. Influent collected from wastewater treatment plant was condensed by Polyethylene Glycol (6000) after the removal of solid particle by centrifugation. Phages were isolated by double layer agar method, whereby single plaque was picked up and purified and propagated.

139	525278	PRJNA525278	Transcriptome or Gene expression	Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an important human pathogen which uses the type III secretion system 21 (T3SS) as a primary virulence factor to establish infections in humans. The results presented in this 22 report revealed that the ATP-binding protein PA4595 (named ArtR, a Regulator that is an ATP-activated 23 Repressor of T3SS) represses T3SS expression in P. aeruginosa. The expression of T3SS genes, 24 including exoS, exoY, exoT, exsCEBA and exsD-pscB-L, increased significantly when artR was 25 knockout. The effect of ArtR on ExsA is at the transcriptional level, not at the translational level. The 26 regulatory role and cytoplasm localization of ArtR suggest it belongs to the REG sub-family of 27 ATP-binding cassette (ABC) family. Purified GST-tagged ArtR showed ATPase activity in vitro. The 28 conserved aspartate residues in the dual Walker B motifs prove to be essential for the regulatory 29 function of ArtR. The regulation of T3SS by ArtR is unique, which does not involve the known 30 GacS/A-RsmY/Z-RsmA-ExsA pathway or Vfr. This is the first REG subfamily of ATP-binding 31 cassette that is reported to regulate T3SS genes in bacteria. The results specify a novel player in the 32 regulatory networks of T3SS in P. aeruginosa.

140	525056	PRJEB31466	Other	To date, carbapenemase production (CP) in Pseudomonas aeruginosa has been rare in Spain and other countries in comparison with mutation-driven resistance, but this may be changing. We characterized a collection of CP P. aeruginosa isolated in Spanish hospitals. During 2016, 232 unduplicated carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa were submitted to the Spanish antibiotic reference lab of which 71 (30.6%) produced carbapenemases and were further analysed by PFGE, MLST and WGS. Using WGS data, the cgMLST and resistome were also studied.Of the 71 CP P. aeruginosa, 39 (54.9%) produced VIM-2, 14 (19.7%) VIM-1, 8 (11.3%) IMP-8, 6 (8.5%) VIM-20, 2 (2.8%) VIM-2 plus KPC-2, one (1.4%) IMP-13 and one (1.4%) VIM-1 plus IMP-18. Four STs (ST175, ST244, ST815 and ST155) encompassed 83.1% of all CP P. aeruginosa. Using cgMLST, 4 clusters were detected: Clusters 1 consisted of nine ST815/VIM-2 isolates; Cluster 2 (n=8) consisted of eight ST175/VIM-2 isolates; Cluster 3 consisted of seven ST244 isolates (five VIM-2 and two VIM-2 plus KPC-2); and Cluster 4 consisted of 12 ST175 isolates (seven VIM-2 and five IMP-8). The average number of acquired resistance genes was significantly higher in the VIM-1-producing isolates (7.1 ± 0.94) than in the VIM-2-producing isolates (average of 4.5± 0.20); the most predominant ones were catB7 (97.2%) and sul1 (87.3%).CP P. aeruginosa isolates are spreading in Spain causing outbreaks and sporadic cases, mainly due to high risk clones such as ST175 and ST244 that have acquired the ability to produce VIM, IMP and KPC carbapenemases.	eSequencing	PAE	eWhole	eGenome	eMonoisolate	Carbapenemase-producing Pseudomonas aeruginosa in Spain: interregional dissemination of the high risk-clones ST175 and ST244 producing VIM-2, VIM-1, IMP-8, VIM-20 and KPC-2						2019-03-01		2019-03-01		Instituto de Salud Carlos III

159	516613	PRJEB23671	Other	In recent years, the characterization of the Type VI secretion system (T6SS), and its associated toxins, has revolutionised our view of bacterial colonisation strategies and the T6SS capacity/diversity is undervalued at this stage of our knowledge. Additionally, given that possession of these systems and associated toxins have been selected as highly favourable for bacteria in an evolutionary sense, the targets of these toxins can be considered as highly valuable potential antibacterial targets. Both P. aeruginosa and P. putida contain three T6SS clusters which exhibit great variety and complexity both in terms of apparatus and secreted toxins. In the case of P. aeruginosa these systems are used to target both prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms which provides a competitive advantage for P. aeruginosa within a wide range of niches. For P. putida these secretion systems are used by the bacterium to drive killing of resilient phytopathogens and appear to be a major player in its biocontrol portfolio. The proposed project will uncover the full repertoire of T6SS toxins associated with all 3 T6SSs in P. aeruginosa. Additionally, TraDIS will be used to investigate the mechanism used by the T6SS of both P. aeruginosa and P. putida to target and deliver toxins into prey cells. The output of this work may offer opportunities for novel therapeutic approaches that can be learned from the targets of T6SS toxins and/or the mechanism of T6SS action.	eSequencing	Uncovering_the_Type_VI_secretion_system__T6SS__toxin_repertoire_and_mechanism_of_toxin_delivery_inPseudomonas_sp__	eWhole	eGenome	eMonoisolate	Uncovering_the_Type_VI_secretion_system__T6SS__toxin_repertoire_and_mechanism_of_toxin_delivery_inPseudomonas_sp__						2019-01-23		2019-01-23		SC

167	513285	PRJEB29539	Other	BackgroundIn this study, we aimed at elucidation of a prolonged outbreak of extensively drug-resistant (XDR) Pseudomonas aeruginosa, going on at two adjacent hospitals over a time period of four years. Since all strains exhibited a similar antibiotic susceptibility pattern and carried the carbapenemase gene blaVIM, we assumed a monoclonal outbreak. To shed light on the intra-hospital evolution of these strains over time, whole genome sequence (WGS) analysis of 100 clinical and environmental outbreak strains was employed. Results Phylogenetic analysis of the core genome revealed the outbreak to be polyclonal, rather than monoclonal as initially suggested. Accessory genome analysis of each of the two major clusters composed of 27 and 59 strains, revealed over 400 and 600 accessory genes, respectively, indicating an unexpected high structural diversity among phylogenetically clustered strains. Our investigation clearly shows both accumulation and loss of genes to occur very frequently over time, as reflected by analysis of protein enrichment as well as functional enrichment. In addition, we investigated adaptation through single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Among the genes affected by SNPs, there are a multidrug efflux pump (mexZ) and a mercury detoxification operon (merR) with deleterious mutations potentially leading to loss of repression with resistance against antibiotics and disinfectants. Conclusions Our results not only confirm WGS to be a powerful tool for epidemiologic analyses, but also provide insights into molecular evolution during an XDR P. aeruginosa hospital outbreak. Genome mutation as well as genomic rearrangements unveiled a striking genetic plasticity on an unexpectedly high level, mostly driven by horizontal gene transfer. Our study adds valuable information to the molecular understanding of ‘real-world’ in-hospital P. aeruginosa evolution and is a step forward to a more personalized medicine in infection control.	eSequencing	Molecular evolution analysis of XDR P. aeruginosa	eWhole	eGenome	eMonoisolate	Molecular evolution of extensively drug-resistant (XDR) Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains from patients and hospital environment in a prolonged outbreak						2019-01-07		2019-01-07		Institute of Medical Microbiology and Hygiene, University Tuebingen

177	508631	PRJNA508631	Transcriptome or Gene expression	Target (MexB) and efflux based mechanisms decreasing the effectiveness of the efflux pump inhibitor D13-9001 in P. aeruginosa PAO1: uncovering a new role for MexMN-OprM in efflux of β-lactams and a novel regulatory circuit (MmnRS) controlling MexMN expression Efflux pumps contribute to antibiotic resistance in Gram-negative pathogens. Correspondingly, efflux pump inhibitors (EPIs) may reverse this resistance. D13-9001 specifically inhibits MexAB-OprM in P. aeruginosa. Mutants with decreased susceptibility to MexAB-OprM inhibition by D13-9001 were identified and these fell into two categories; those having alterations in the target MexB (F628L and ΔV177) and those with mutations in PA1438 (L172P substitution) which encoded a putative sensor kinase of unknown function. The alterations in MexB were consistent with reported structural studies of D13-9001 interaction with MexB. The PA1438L172P alteration mediated a >150-fold upregulation of MexMN pump gene expression and >50-fold upregulation of PA1438 and the neighboring response regulator gene PA1437. We propose that these be renamed as mmnR/mmnS for MexMN Regulator and Sensor. MexMN was shown to partner with the outer membrane channel protein OprM and to pump several β-lactams, monobactams and tazobactam. Upregulated MexMN functionally replaced MexAB-OprM to efflux these compounds but was insusceptible to inhibition by D13-9001. MmnSL172P also mediated a decrease in susceptibility to imipenem / biapenem that was independent of MexMN-OprM. Expression of oprD, encoding the uptake channel for these compounds was downregulated, suggesting that this channel is also part of the MmnSR regulon. RNA-seq of cells encoding MmnSL172P revealed among other things an interrelationships between regulation of mexMN and genes involved in heavy metal resistance.

182	508412	PRJNA508412	Transcriptome or Gene expression	Oxygenated unsaturated fatty acids, known as oxylipins, are signaling molecules commonly used for cell-to-cell communication in eukaryotes. However, a role for oxylipins in mediating communication in prokaryotes has not previously been described. Bacteria mainly communicate via quorum sensing (QS) , which involves the production and detection of diverse small molecules termed autoinducers. We showed that oleic acid-derived oxylipins 10-HOME and 7,10-DiHOME produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa function as autoinducers of a novel quorum sensing system termed Oxylipin-Dependent QS Sytem (ODS). This experiment was designed to determine the genes whose expression is altered by these P. aeruginosa oxylipins. We found that the ODS system controls the cell density-dependent expression of a P. aeruginosa gene subset through the mediation of 10-HOME and 7,10-DiHOME oxylipins. Overall design: Pseudomonas aeruginosa mRNA profiles of strain PAO1 ΔPA2076 (ΔodsR ) in the absence or presence of oleic acid or its derived oxylipins 10-HOME and 7,10-DiHOME.	eSequencing	Determination of Pseudomonas aeruginosa transcriptome induced by oleic acid or its derived oxylipins 10-HOME and 7,10-DiHOME.	eWhole	eTranscriptome	eMultiisolate	Determination of Pseudomonas aeruginosa transcriptome induced by oleic acid or its derived oxylipins 10-HOME and 7,10-DiHOME.			287	287	eBacteria	2018-12-04		2019-02-27		Bacteriology, Infectious Diseases, Southern Research	ePublished	2019-02-23T00:00:00Z	30793044	ePubmed

186	507097	PRJNA507097	Genome sequencing and assembly	Pseudomonas aeruginosa is one of the most important pathogens in cystic fibrosis. In this study we analysed the genetic basis and phylogenetic profile of resistance to ceftazidime/avibactam and ceftolozane/tazobactam in cystic fibrosis P. aeruginosa. The study focussed on a collection of isolates resistant to piperacillin/tazobactam from four hospitals in Scotland since the introduction of these two third-generation cephalosporin/β-lactamase inhibitor combinations. The majority of isolates (55%) were resistant to ceftazidime/avibactam and ceftolozane/tazobactam or both with resistance due to AmpC overexpression or ampC derepression. Most isolates (83%) were also resistant to carbapenems primarily as a result of inactivating mutations in the chromosomal oprD gene. None of the isolates bore class A, B, D plasmid-encoded carbapenemases. Critically, we show that mutational resistance emerged in phylogenetically distant lineages suggesting that the mutations occur independently without seeming to confer a selective advantage to any phylogenetic lineage. Our findings confirm the strong contribution of mutation-driven evolution to the population structure of P. aeruginosa.	eSequencing	Pseudomonas aeruginosa	eWhole	eGenome	eMultiisolate	Phylogenetic analysis of resistance to ceftazidime/avibactam and ceftolozane/tazobactam in piperacillin/tazobactam-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa from cystic fibrosis patients			287	287	eBacteria	2018-11-27	2018-12-04T00:00:00Z	2018-11-27	yes	University of Aberdeen
187	506970	PRJNA506970	Transcriptome or Gene expression	We demonstrate that the versatile environmental bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa adapts a virulence phenotype after serial passage in Galleria mellonella as an invertebrate model host. The virulence phenotype was not linked to the acquisition of genetic variations and was sustained for several generations, despite cultivation of the ex vivo virulence-adapted P. aeruginosa cells under non-inducing rich medium conditions. Transcriptional reprogramming seemed to be induced by a host-specific food source as reprogramming was also observed upon cultivation of P. aeruginosa in medium supplemented with polyunsaturated long-chain fatty acids. Methods : mRNA profiles were generated for Pseudomonas aerugionsa samples derived from LB-cultures grown to an OD600 =2. The removal of ribosomal RNA was performed using the Ribo-Zero Bacteria Kit (Illumina) and cDNA libraries were generated with the ScriptSeq v2 Kit (Illumina) . The samples were sequenced in single end mode on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 device and mRNA reads were trimmed and mapped to the NC_008463.1 (PA14) reference genome from NCBI using Stampy pipeline with defaut settings. Overall design: Isolate CH2658 was subjected to in vivo and in vitro evolution experiments in this study. This isolate was obtained from the lab of G. Gastmeier, Charite Berlin, Germany. The in vivo passages (using G. mellonella) are named CH2658 I-IV corresponding to passages 1 4. The last passage CH2658 IV corresponds to the “evolved strain” and was passaged in LB (four days, two passages a day) to generate revertants which are referred to as CH2658 Rev1-4 corresponding to samples from day1-4. The last passage CH2658 Rev4 is called “revertant”. Additionally, the clinical isolate was passaged under in vitro conditions in the presence of linolenic acid (Roth) with (CH2658 Lil+P) and without paraffin (CH2658 Lil). As controls, CH2658 was passaged in LB (CH2658 LB) and in LB supplemented with paraffin (CH2658 LB+P). The in vitro passage experiment was conducted for four days and two passages a day.	eSequencing	Using RNA Seq to investigate adaptation mechanisms in P. aeruginosa	eWhole	eTranscriptome	eMultiisolate	Using RNA Seq to investigate adaptation mechanisms in P. aeruginosa			287	287	eBacteria	2018-11-26		2019-07-08		Häußler, Molecular Bacteriology, TWINCORE	ePublished	2019-04-07T00:00:00Z	30952997	ePubmed

Transcriptional reprogramming seemed to be induced by a host-specific food source as reprogramming was also observed upon cultivation of P. aeruginosa in medium supplemented with polyunsaturated long-chain fatty acids. The establishment of induced memory responses thus adds a time dimension and seems to fill the gap between long-term evolutionary genotypic adaptation and short-term induced individual responses. Efforts to unravel the fundamental mechanisms that underlie the carry-over effect to induce such memory responses will continue to be of importance as they ultimately drive survival of bacterial populations in changing and challenging habitats.	eSequencing		eWhole	eGenome	eMultispecies	Memory response in Pseudomonas aeruginosa during infection of a eukaryotic host						2018-11-22		2018-11-22		TWINCORE

193	505797	PRJEB26817	Other	Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an environmental microorganism and a causative agent of diverse acute and chronic, biofilm-associated infections. Advancing research-based knowledge on its adaptation to conditions within the human host is bound to reveal novel strategies and targets for therapeutic intervention. Here, we investigated the traits that P. aeruginosa PA14 as well as a virulence attenuated ∆lasR mutant need to survive in selected murine infection models. Experimentally, the genetic programs that the bacteria use to adapt to biofilm-associated versus acute infections were dissected by passaging transposon mutant libraries through mouse lungs (acute) or mouse tumors (biofilm-infection). Adaptive metabolic changes of P. aeruginosa were generally required during both infection processes. Counter-selection against flagella expression was observed during acute lung infections. Obviously, avoidance of flagella-mediated activation of host immunity is advantageous for the wildtype bacteria. For the ∆lasR mutant, loss of flagella did not confer a selective advantage. Apparently, other pathogenesis mechanisms are active in this virulence attenuated strain. In contrast, the infective process of P. aeruginosa in the chronic biofilm model apparently required expression of flagellin. Together, our findings imply that the host immune reactions against the infectious agent are very decisive for acuteness and duration of the infectious disease. They direct disease outcome.

194	505368	PRJNA505368	raw sequence reads	Complete genome sequences of organisms are the foundation of understanding biological functions. High-throughput parallel sequencing technologies such as Illumina make the bacterial genomic analyses possible and efficient, and benefit public health and basic bacterial related research. The short-read platforms have limits of resolving complete genome sequences and complex genomic structures. Long-read data generated by Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) show great potential in finishing complete bacterial genomes. In this study, we evaluated the ability of ONT in completing bacterial genomes for twelve different species of both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. Bacterial genomes can be completed when the data volume is larger than 20×coverage of the genome in average, although manual curations are needed in certain circumstances. Importantly, de novo assembly of genomes based on ONT reads could be affected by assembly tools, some of which may result in misassembled genomes. Careful comparison of assembly results of various tools should be conducted before obtaining accurate results. With the improvement of ONT read quality and platforms, the discrepancy of assemblies between assembly tools may disappear in future. Also, finishing multiple genomes (twelve or more) of different bacterial species in a single MinION run with a rapid library preparation method are becoming possible as the technology improves.	eSequencing		eWhole	eGenome	eMultispecies	Evaluation of De novo assembly of bacterial genomes with rapid MinION sequencing platform						2018-11-13		2018-11-13		Yangzhou University

199	504405	PRJNA504405	Transcriptome or Gene expression	Bacterial gene expression is controlled by modifying the promoter affinity of the RNA polymerase (RNAP). This control occurs through the substitution of the RNAP σ subunit and by the interaction with transcription factors. The pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa contains several σ factors, including σVreI. This protein belongs to the extracytoplasmic function group of the σ70 family. Expression and activity of σECFs are tightly regulated and only occur in response to specific signals. σVreI is encoded within the vreAIR gene cluster. The expression of this cluster occurs in response to inorganic phosphate (Pi) limitation. σVreI activity is modulated by VreR anti-sigma factor, which keeps σVreI inactive. In response to a still unidentified host signal, VreR is proteolytically degraded and σVreI released and activated. σVreI interacts then with the RNAP and targets expression of the σVreI regulon, which includes virulence genes that increase P. aeruginosa pathogenicity. In this work, we compared the transcriptome of the P. aeruginosa PAO1 wild-type strain with that of the ΔvreR mutant upon bacterial growth in Pi starvation. Forty-six transcripts were more abundant in the ΔvreR mutant than in the PAO1 wild-type strain, and nine were less abundant, including the vreR transcript. Overall design: P. aeruginosa PAO1 and ΔvreR mutant were grown until late exponential phase in low Pi medium and total RNA was isolated. A mixture of the three isolations was used for RNA-seq analyses.	eSequencing	Comparative RNA-seq analysis of the transcriptome of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 wild-type strain with that of the ΔvreR mutant	eWhole	eTranscriptome	eMultiisolate	Comparative RNA-seq analysis of the transcriptome of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 wild-type strain with that of the ΔvreR mutant			287	287	eBacteria	2018-11-07		2019-03-13		Signal transduction by cell-surface signaling systems and virulence, Environmental Protection.

212	496467	PRJNA496467	Transcriptome or Gene expression	Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a Gram-negative opportunistic pathogen of humans, most notably those with cystic fibrosis or whose immune systems are compromised. As a global regulator, MvfR,RhlR and QscR have been characterized to control a group of virulence-related factors and quorum sensing (QS) genes in P. aeruginosa, but its detailed molecular regulatory mechanism is largely elusive. To further gain insights into the direct targets of MvfR,RhlR and QscR in viv, this study focused on identifying the potential targets of MvfR,RhlR and QscR directly regulating QS system and other vireulence pathways. We performed a chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled to high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) assay that identified 221, 30 and 1 binding sites of MvfR,RhlR and QscR. The direct regulation of these genes by MvfR,RhlR and QscR have been biochemically and genetically verified. The results indicated that MvfR,RhlR and QscR had direct and profound effects on QS, which provides new cues to better understand the detailed regulatory networks of virulence.

224	491911	PRJNA491911	raw sequence reads	Pathogens experience pressure in an infection to adapt, favoring mutants that persist. Pseudomonas aeruginosa commonly adapts by evolving mutants with hyper-biofilm production that evade host immunity and have increased antimicrobial tolerance. Despite our understanding of these adaptive phenotypes, studying their emergence in an infection has proven challenging. Here we used a porcine full-thickness burn wound model of chronic infection to study how mixed strains of P. aeruginosa adaptively evolve. Burns were infected with six different P. aeruginosa strains, including the model PA14 strain (PA14-1), and biopsies taken at 3, 14, and 28 days post infection. Rugose small-colony variants (RSCVs) were detected at 3-d and persisted, with the majority evolved from PA14-1. Whole genome sequencing of PA14-1 RSCVs revealed driver mutations exclusively in the wsp pathway which led to elevated cyclic-di-GMP and the RSCV phenotype. The rapid rise of these mutants to detectable frequencies is evidence of positive selection of the Wsp chemosensory system and challenges the dogma that RSCVs only evolve following prolonged evolution in chronic infections. Given the prevalence of P. aeruginosa RSCVs and related opportunists in other chronic infections, we predict that RSCVs may be a common, early adaptation to persist during infections.	eSequencing	Pseudomonas aeruginosa UCBPP-PA14	eWhole	eGenome	eMultiisolate	The Pseudomonas aeruginosa Wsp pathway undergoes positive evolutionary selection during chronic infection		UCBPP-PA14	208963	287	eBacteria	2018-09-19		2018-09-19	yes	Univeristy of Pittsburgh

228	490820	PRJNA490820	raw sequence reads	For bacterial genome sequencing, libraries from different strains are usually multiplexed in a single run. Normalized libraries are most often pooled in equal volumes, as recommended by next-generation sequencing platform manufacturers. This equal-volume strategy is well suited for multiplexing isolates from the same species. However, for runs involving multiple microbial species an equimolar library pooling is more adapted because of the variation in bacterial genome size. To demonstrate its utility in clinical microbiology, we compared both equal-volume and equimolar strategies using a menu comprising 13 bacterial species involved in healthcare-associated infections. We show that equimolar pooling limits the retesting risk due to insufficient coverage depth, particularly when inter-species genome size difference is more than 2-fold. The use of this alternative strategy for multiplexing pathogenic bacteria should lead to more cost effective whole-genome sequencing applications in clinical microbiology.	eSequencing		eWhole	eGenome	eMultispecies	Equimolar NGS library pooling for multiplexing bacterial species						2018-09-14		2018-09-14		BIOMERIEUX	ePublished		31227316	ePubmed

234	489391	PRJNA489391	raw sequence reads	Chronic bacterial infections on medical devices, including catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTI), are associated with bacterial biofilm communities that are refractory to antibiotic therapy and resistant to host immunity. Previously, we have shown that Pseudomonas aeruginosa can cause CAUTI by forming a device-associated biofilm that is independent of known biofilm exopolysaccharides. Here, we show by RNA-seq that host urine alters the transcriptome of P. aeruginosa by suppressing quorum sensing regulated genes. P. aeruginosa produces acyl homoserine lactones (AHLs) in the presence of urea, but cannot perceive AHLs. Repression of quorum sensing by urine implies that quorum sensing should be dispensable during infection of the urinary tract. Mutants defective in quorum sensing was able to colonize similarly to wild-type in a murine model of CAUTI. Quorum sensing-regulated processes in clinical isolates are also inhibited by urea. These data show that urea in urine is a natural anti-quorum sensing mechanism in mammals.	eSequencing	Pseudomonas aeruginosa UCBPP-PA14	eWhole	eGenome	eMultiisolate	Host suppression of quorum sensing during catheter associated urinary tract infections;Catheter associated urinary tract infection by Pseudomonas aeruginosa		UCBPP-PA14	208963	287	eBacteria	2018-09-05		2018-09-05	yes	University of Maryland at College Park

243	487548	PRJEB20836	Other	CF is an inherited life-limiting, disorder which although can affect a number of other organs, mortality results primarily from progression of lung disease. Acute deteriorations in lung infection, termed 'acute pulmonary exacerbations' (APEs) are the single most important cause of CF morbidity and mortality. Despite this, little is understood about the pathophysiological processes that trigger APEs, but are thought to be driven by respiratory infections. However, there is no substantive evidence to date that the presence or load of individual species is driving this process. This may reflect the complex underlying microbial diversity found in the CF lung at both the inter and intra species level. Metagenomics will be carried out on daily sputum samples collected from CF patients in order to characterise longitudinal patterns of the within-host diversity of bacteria within the CF lung, and how these changes relate to clinical events.

245	486815	PRJNA486815	Transcriptome or Gene expression	Purpose: Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has revolutionized systems-based analysis of cellular pathways. The goals of this study are to compare transcriptome profiling of control of P. aeruginosa PAO1 (RNA-seq) to transcriptome profiling of diallyl disulphide-treated P. aeruginosa PAO1 and to evaluate protocols for optimal high-throughput data analysis. Methods: Every 50 mL LB medium was inoculated exponential growth phase of P. aeruginosa PAO1, with the bacterial concentration of 108 CFU/mL. Then DDS was added, with its concentrations were 0 (as control, three biological repeats numbered A1, A2, and A3) and 0.64 mg/mL (three biological repeats numbered B1, B2, and B3) separately, both with a triplicate. All the six experiment groups were incubated in a water bath shaker at 37 ºC with a shaking rate at 150 rpm for 5 hours. The cells were then sampled and centrifuged from the three control groups and three DDS treatment groups, respectively. The cell precipitates in the control and DDS-treated groups were quickly separately frozen at -80 ºC. Total RNA was isolated from cells using Trizol (Life Technologies, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Results: The RNA sequencing results revealed that a large number of genes in P. aeruginosa PAO1 were differentially expressed after DDS treatment. More than three thousands of genes were differentially expressed, with either up regulated (1649 genes) or down regulated (1725 genes) more than two-fold. Conclusions: Overall design: The mRNA profiles of P. aeruginosa PAO1 (ck) and DDS-treated P. aeruginosa PAO1 (sample1) were generated by deep sequencing, in triplicate, using Illumina Higseq 2000.	eSequencing	Next Generation Sequencing Facilitates Quantitative Analysis of control of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 and diallyl disulphide-treated P. aeruginosa PAO1 Transcriptomes	eWhole	eTranscriptome	eMultiisolate	Next Generation Sequencing Facilitates Quantitative Analysis of control of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 and diallyl disulphide-treated P. aeruginosa PAO1 Transcriptomes			208964	287	eBacteria	2018-08-20		2019-02-13		Guangdong Institute of Microbiology	ePublished	2019-01-23T00:00:00Z	30666240	ePubmed

247	486465	PRJNA486465	genome sequencing	In the chronically infected habitat of the cystic fibrosis (CF) lung, an environment-specific transcriptional profile is produced, that reflects a plastic bacterial response to the challenging conditions. Previous studies have demonstrated that Pseudomonas aeruginosa exhibits substantial genetic diversification in diverse sub-compartments of the CF lung. This study aimed to show that despite genetic compartmentalization the in vivo transcriptional profile is not significantly different between P. aeruginosa populations inhabiting the upper and lower, central or peripheral sub-compartments of the CF lung and that this is due to a plastic response that aids the maintenance of genetic diversity by dampening the selection force.	eSequencing	Pseudomonas aeruginosa	eWhole	eGenome	eMultiisolate	Pseudomonas aeruginosa Genome sequencing			287	287	eBacteria	2018-08-17		2018-08-17		TWINCORE

250	485088	PRJEB20566	Other	In a previously very successful collaboration with the WTSI we have used TraDIS to identify known and novel H1-T6SS associated toxin-immunity pairs. Additionally, this work was able to identify genes which may have a protective role for the cell against T6SS targeting. While the receptor target for other similar contact-dependent systems has been identified and characterised, this has been neglected in the T6SS field. We hypothesis that the genes identified through TraDIS which provide protection against H1-T6SS mediated killing, act as T6SS receptors on the target cell. We are currently in the process of fully characterising the novel putative toxin-immunity pairs and putative receptor targets which we have identified in this work. In the current proposal we will extend this work to identify novel H2- and H3-T6SS associated toxin-immunity genes and receptor targets in P. aerguinosa. Additionally, we will generate TraDIS libraries in E. coli and P. putida and compete these libraries against T6SS active or inactive P. aeruginosa attacking strains. The aim of this work will be to recover E. coli and P. putida mutants which lack the T6SS target receptor(s), as these should not be killed in the competition assay against the active T6SS strain.

257	481915	PRJEB27828	Other	The ability of phage to counter-adapt against bacterial resistance has made them an appealing prospect in the development of phage therapy as an antimicrobial treatment. Many phage therapies are cocktails of multiple phage strains aimed to target a broad range of bacterial targets. Antagonistic co- evolution between bacteria and phage has been studied for many years in a pairwise context, but we know less about the nature of coevolution in a community context and how resistance against a diverse group of phage might evolve. Using a collection of Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains isolated from cystic fibrosis patients and associated lytic phage strains we are exploring the occurrence of cross-resistance, where the evolution of resistance to one phage strain prevents infection by other phage strains. Further, we are investigating the fitness costs associated with varying degrees of cross resistance and the genetic mutations they represent. Utilising bipartite network analysis techniques we have characterised the resistance ranges of 280 spontaneous resistance mutants against 28 lytic phage strains. We have found surprisingly high levels of cross resistance across a broad phylogenetic spectrum of phage strains, and have observed multiple resistance profiles initiated against each phage strain. These results suggest that, although the potential for phage therapy against P. aeruginosa infections is great, we must consider the propensity for development of cross resistance to multiple phage strains, and consider this in the rational design of phage therapy cocktails.	eSequencing		eWhole	eGenome	eMonoisolate	Exploring bacteria-phage infection networks						2018-07-19		2018-07-19		UNIVERSITY OF BIRMINGHAM

259	481107	PRJEB21755	Other	AUST-2 is one of the most common Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) clones in Australian cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. It is particularly common in Brisbane, Queensland (Qld.) and Perth, Western Australia (WA) on opposite sides of the continent, but is also found in other cities. We sequenced the genomes of 45 isolates from 31 patients. We have found that these isolates are highly clonal and thus probably had a single jump from environment to patient followed by spread between patients. We estimate that this initial infection event occurred in the 1990s. We also found that an aadB aminoglycoside resistance gene previously found in Brisbane AUST-2 isolates is located on a plasmid. Some of the isolates from Perth had DNA repair gene mutations and thus had taken on a mutator phenotype, acquiring numerous unique mutations. Whereas in Queensland, isolates differing by only one or two single nucleotide variations were found in different patients	eSequencing	Whole genome sequencing of Pseudomonas aeruginosa Australian epidemic clone AUST-02 from CF patients	eWhole	eGenome	eMonoisolate	Evolution of the AUST-2 prevalent strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in Australian CF patients						2018-07-14		2018-07-14		UQ
260	480615	PRJEB20809	Other	The emergence and spread of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) poses a significant challenge to the safe delivery of modern medical care. Multidrug-resistant organisms (MDRO) are found more commonly in healthcare settings where they contribute to the burden of healthcare-associated infections (HCAI). Patients in intensive care units are particularly vulnerable to HCAI as they are critically ill, have multiple invasive medical devices and are frequently treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics (which select antibiotic resistant organisms). Several outbreaks of infection caused by MDRO in intensive care units have been reported. They are often identified late, and are associated with high mortality. Microbial whole-genome sequencing (WGS) is an emerging technology that will transform the practice of clinical microbiology. We have previously conducted one of the first studies to demonstrate the potential utility of WGS in a nosocomial outbreak investigation, involving an MRSA outbreak at Addenbrooke’s Hospital. A number of other studies have used WGS retrospectively to investigate nosocomial outbreaks caused by MDROs. Our study will focus on the prevalence and transmission of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) and multidrug-resistant Gram negative bacilli. We will conduct a prospective surveillance study of MDRO in adults admitted to an intensive care unti at Addenbrooke’s Hospital. This will enable us to determine the rates of carriage, infection and transmission in this vulnerable patient population, and to identify possible intervention and control strategies. We will compare standard epidemiological investigation / typing with WGS in the investigation of suspected MDRO outbreaks, along with a health economic evaluation between these methods.	eSequencing	ICUUKseq_GNB	eWhole	eGenome	eMonoisolate	ICUUKseq_GNB						2018-07-11		2018-07-11		SC
261	479815	PRJNA479815	raw sequence reads	Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a bacterial pathogen involved in a variety of serious human infections. The high intrinsic resistance of this bacterium to antibiotics and its aptitude to acquire new resistances by horizontal gene transfer demands for the development of new therapeutic strategies. Epidemiological and experimental evidence links the outcome of P. aeruginosa infections to the ability of the bacterium to exploit glucose as carbon source within the host. Hence glucose uptake and metabolism appears as an interesting target for the development of anti-pseudomonas drugs. This work shows that interfering with P. aeruginosa glucose uptake has a strong impact on transcriptome and virulence in vitro and could have opposite effects in vivo, depending on the specific mutation and on the type of infection model. Overall, our results highlight that a deep knowledge of bacterial metabolism and nutritional milieu within the host is required in order to devise effective antibacterial strategies relying on the inhibition of bacterial metabolic functions.	eSequencing		eWhole	eGenome	eMultispecies	Pseudomonas aeruginosa mutants defective in glucose uptake						2018-07-05		2018-07-05	yes	National Research Council (CNR)	ePublished		30442901	ePubmed

279	472916	PRJEB25016	Other	Bacteria evolve CRISPR-Cas immunity against bacteriophage (phage) by inserting phage-derived sequences into CRISPR loci on the host1, which can drive rapid phage extinction2. Some phages encode anti-CRISPR (acr) genes, which antagonize CRISPR-Cas immune systems by binding components of its machinery3-20, but it is less clear how these acr genes impact phage replication and epidemiology. Here we demonstrate that bacteria with CRISPR-Cas resistance are still partially immune to Acr-encoding phage. As a consequence, Acr-phages often need to cooperate in order to overcome CRISPR resistance, with a first phage taking down the host CRISPR-Cas immune system for a second Acr-phage to successfully replicate. This requirement for cooperation leads to epidemiological tipping points in which the initial density of Acr-phage tips the balance from phage extinction to a phage epidemic. Furthermore, both higher levels of CRISPR-Cas immunity and weaker Acr activities shift the tipping points towards higher phage densities. Collectively these data help to understand how interactions between phage-encoded immune suppressors and the CRISPR systems they target shape bacteria-phage population dynamics.

VIM-2 is the predominant gene, which has been linked to high-risk strains causing outbreaks. Remarkable in Sweden, eight patients were colonized by VIM-2 producing P. aeruginosa, during a period of 15 months, at two neighbouring hospitals. To find the source and halt this clustering an epidemiological investigation was initiated. The isolates had similar antibiograms and identical PFGE patterns, indicating a nosocomial spread. Screening of co-patients and staff yielded no additional cases. The case patients had been in the same rooms and wards, but long separated in time. Environmental screening showed growth of P. aeruginosa with identical PFGE-pattern in two sinks from rooms where the patients had been staying, whereof one in the intensive care unit. The outbreak strain was analysed with whole genome sequencing and belonged to the high-risk strain ST111. The blaVIM-2 gene was not within the class 1 integron and the OprD-porin was mutated. The colonized hospital sinks were a probable reservoir, which contributed to the first and prolonged nosocomial outbreak of MBL-producing P. auruginosa in Sweden. As the sinks were replace the outbreak ended.	eSequencing	Pseudomonas aeruginosa outbreak Karlskrona, Sweden	eWhole	eGenome	eMonoisolate	Pseudomonas aeruginosa outbreak Karlskrona, Sweden						2018-05-10		2018-05-10		UPPSALA UNIVERISTY

316	438639	PRJEB24427	Other	Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) fuels evolution in prokaryotes. Plasmids are key drivers of HGT because they spread across bacteria by conjugation. Plasmids provide bacteria with new adaptive genes, but at the same time, they produce a physiological alteration that often translates into a reduction in bacterial fitness. Although the fitness costs associated with plasmids represent the main limit to plasmid acquisition, their molecular origins remain largely unknown. In this work we developed a novel approach combining phenomics, transcriptomics and metabolomics to study the effects produced by a collection of diverse plasmids in the opportunistic pathogen P. aeruginosa PAO1. We used this approach to scan the physiological changes imposed by plasmids in PAO1 and to investigate some of the main mechanisms that have been proposed to explain the cost of HGT. Our results suggest that the fitness effects of plasmids have a complex origin, since none of the suspected sources of cost could explain them individually. Interestingly, our results also showed that plasmids alter the expression of a common set of metabolic genes in PAO1, and produce convergent changes in host cell metabolism. These surprising results suggest that there is a common metabolic response to plasmids in P. aeruginosa PAO1.	eSequencing		eWhole	eGenome	eMonoisolate	Integrative analysis of fitness and metabolic effects of plasmids in Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1						2018-03-16		2018-03-16		UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD

Over time this has created a gap between what researchers understand about bacteria growing in the lab and those growing in patients. It is well-known that the behavior of bacteria is shaped by their environment, but how this behavior differs in laboratory models compared to human infections is poorly understood. We compared transcription data from a variety of human infections with data from a range of in vitro samples. We found important differences in expression of genes involved in antibiotic resistance, cell-cell communication, and metabolism. Understanding the bacterial expression patterns in human patients is a necessary step toward improved therapy and the development of more accurate laboratory models.	eSequencing		eWhole	eGenome	eMultispecies	RNAseq of P. aeruginosa in humans						2018-03-12		2018-03-12	yes	Georgia Institute of Technology

324	436679	PRJEB24070	Other	Populations of Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonise the upper airway of cystic fibrosis patients, providing a reservoir of host-adapted genotypes that subsequently establish chronic lung infection. We have previously experimentally evolved P. aeruginosa LESB65 in a murine model of chronic respiratory tract infection and observed mutations in pmrB that promoted establishment and persistence of infection. Here we show that mutations in pmrB, which encodes the sensor kinase of the PmrAB two-component regulatory system, are acquired early in infection and result in increased resistance to the host antimicrobial lysozyme but enhanced susceptibility to multiple antibiotics. Proteomic analysis of a ΔpmrB deletion mutant revealed downregulation of proteins involved in LPS biosynthesis, antimicrobial resistance and phenazine production, and upregulation of proteins involved in adherence, lysozyme resistance and inhibition of the chloride ion channel CFTR, relative to wild-type LESB65. Accordingly, ΔpmrB showed enhanced adherence to airway epithelial cells and induced downregulation of host airway epithelial cell CFTR expression. Mutations in pmrB are found in P. aeruginosa isolates from CF patients and are associated with the same host-adapted phenotypes, but are subject to an evolutionary trade-off: While mutations in pmrB provide enhanced colonisation potential, resistance to host immune defences and the ability to modulate the host environment through CFTR inhibition, they concomitantly increase susceptibility to antibiotics.	eSequencing	Evolutionary trade-offs associated with pmrB mutations in host-adapted Pseudomonas aeruginosa	eWhole	eGenome	eMonoisolate	Evolutionary trade-offs associated with pmrB mutations in host-adapted Pseudomonas aeruginosa						2018-03-02		2018-03-02		CENTRE FOR GENOMIC RESEARCH (CGR)

329	435002	PRJEB23190	Other	Bacterial opportunistic pathogens are feared for their difficult-to-treat nosocomial infections and for causing morbidity in immunocompromised patients. Here, we study how such a versatile opportunist, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, adapts to conditions inside and outside its model host Caenorhabditis elegans, and use phenotypic and genotypic screens to identify the mechanistic basis of virulence evolution. We found that virulence significantly dropped in unstructured environments both in the presence and absence of the host, but remained unchanged in spatially structured environments. The observed virulence decline was driven by a substantial reduction in the production of multiple virulence factors, including siderophores, toxins, and proteases. Because these virulence factors are secreted, we argue that the spread of non-producers is at least partially due to cheating, where mutants exploit the shareable virulence factors produced by the wildtype. Whole-genome sequencing of evolved clones revealed positive selection and parallel evolution across replicates, and showed an accumulation of mutations in regulator genes, controlling the expression of these virulence factors. Our study identifies the spatial structure of the non-host environment as a key driver of virulence evolution in an opportunistic pathogen, and indicates that disrupting spatial structure in chronic infections could steer pathogen evolution towards lower virulence.	eSequencing	Virulence evolution in the opportunistic bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa	eWhole	eGenome	eMonoisolate	Virulence evolution in the opportunistic bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa						2018-02-21		2018-02-21		LUDWIG-MAXIMILIANS UNIVERSITY MUNICH, MUNICH, GERMANY

338	433727	PRJNA433727	Transcriptome or Gene expression	Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a Gram-negative opportunistic pathogen of humans, most notably those with cystic fibrosis or whose immune systems are compromised. As a global regulator, RpoN has been characterized to control a group of virulence-related factors and quorum sensing (QS) genes in P. aeruginosa, but its detailed molecular regulatory mechanism is largely elusive. To further gain insights into the direct targets of RpoN in vivo, this study focused on identifying the potential targets of RpoN directly regulating QS system and T6SS. We performed a chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled to high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) assay that identified 1, 068 binding sites of RpoN, including mostly metabolic genes, a group of genes in QS (lasI, rhlI and pqsR) and type VI secretion system (T6SS) (hcpA and hcpB). The direct regulation of these genes by RpoN has been biochemically and genetically verified. Results revealed that, on one hand, the deletion of rpoN resulted in reduced production of pyocyanin, motility and proteolytic activity. On the other hand, the production of rhamnolipids and biofilm formation was higher in the RpoN mutant than in the wild-type. In sum, the results indicated that RpoN had direct and profound effects on QS and T6SS, which provides new cues to better understand the detailed regulatory networks of virulence.

339	432963	PRJNA432963	Epigenomics	ParA and ParB homologs are involved in accurate chromosome segregation in bacteria. ParBs participate in proper folding and initial separation of ori domains by binding to specific parS sites (palindromic centromere-like sequences), mainly localized close to oriC. Bioinformatic analyses identified 10 parS sequences in the Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 genome. One parS from the parS1-parS4 cluster is required for ParB mediated chromosome segregation. To verify the binding of ParB to all known parSs in vivo as well as to identify additional ParB binding sites we performed chromation immunoprecipitation (ChIP) using polyclonal anti-ParB antibodies followed by high throughput sequencing. ChIP was performed with P. aeruginosa PAO1161 (WT) cells, PAO1161 pKB9 (ParB+++) cells with a slight, non-toxic ParB overproduction as well as with 3 strains containing parS modifications impairing ParB binding to these sites. The data confirmed ParB binding to all known parS sequences with the exception of parS5. Moreover, we identified more than a 1000 of new ParB-bound regions, majority of which contained a DNA motif corresponding to inner 7 nt from one arm of the parS palindrome. ParB interactions with these numerous sites could affect chromosome topology, compaction and gene expression classifying P. aeruginosa ParB as a Nucleoid Associated Protein (NAP). Overall design: ChIP was performed with P. aeruginosa PAO1161 (WT) cells, PAO1161 pKB9 (araBADp-parB) cells with a 5-fold ParB overproduction. Additionally, three parS mutants were included: parSnull with all ten parS sites mutated, parS1-4 mutant with the four high affinity ParB sites inactivated, and parS2+ strain with nine parS sequences modified and only parS2 left intact (Jecz et al., 2015). PAO1161 parBnull mutant, with parB gene disrupted was used as a negative control. Each strain was analysed in duplicate. Additionally, input DNA (DNA before incubation with antibodies) was sequenced for WT strain.	eSequencing	Genome-wide identification of ParB binding sites in Pseudomonas aeruginosa	eWhole	eGenome	eMultiisolate	Genome-wide identification of ParB binding sites in Pseudomonas aeruginosa			287	287	eBacteria	2018-02-05		2019-08-13		Department of Microbial Biochemistry, Institute of Biochemistry and Biophysics, PAS	ePublished	2018-04-13T00:00:00Z	29648658	ePubmed
340	432618	PRJNA432618	Transcriptome or Gene expression	Surfing motility is a novel form of surface adaptation exhibited by the nosocomial pathogen, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, in the presence of the glycoprotein mucin that is found in high abundance at mucosal surfaces especially the lungs of cystic fibrosis and bronchiectasis patients. Here we investigated the adaptive antibiotic resistance of P. aeruginosa under conditions in which surfing occurs compared to cells undergoing swimming. P. aeruginosa surfing cells were significantly more resistant to several classes of antibiotics including aminoglycosides, carbapenems, polymyxins, and fluroquinolones. This was confirmed by incorporation of antibiotics into growth medium, which revealed a concentration-dependent inhibition of surfing motility that occurred at concentrations much higher than those needed to inhibit swimming. To investigate the basis of resistance, RNA-Seq was performed and revealed that surfing influenced the expression of numerous genes. Included amongst genes dysregulated under surfing conditions were multiple genes from the Pseudomonas resistome, which are known to affect antibiotic resistance when mutated. Screening transposon mutants in these surfing-dysregulated resistome genes revealed that several of these mutants exhibited changes in susceptibility to one or more antibiotics under surfing conditions, consistent with a contribution to the observed adaptive resistance. In particular, several mutants in resistome genes, including armR, recG, atpB, clpS, nuoB, and certain hypothetical genes such as PA5130, PA3576 and PA4292, showed contributions to broad-spectrum resistance under surfing conditions and could be complemented by their respective cloned genes. Therefore, we propose that surfing adaption led to extensive multidrug adaptive resistance as a result of the collective dysregulation of diverse genes.

347	430510	PRJNA430510	Transcriptome or Gene expression	Intrinsic and acquired defenses against bacteriophages, including Restriction/Modification, CRISPR/Cas, and Toxin/Anti-toxin systems have been intensely studied, with profound scientific impacts. However, adaptive defenses against phage infection analogous to adaptive resistance to antimicrobials have yet to be described. To identify such mechanisms, we applied an RNAseq-based, comparative transcriptomics approach in different \textit{Pseudomonas aeruginosa} strains after independent infection by a set of divergent virulent bacteriophages. A common host-mediated adaptive stress response to phages was identified that includes the Pseudomonas Quinolone Signal, through which infected cells inform their neighbors of infection, and what may be a resistance mechanism that functions by reducing infection vigor. With host transcriptional machinery left intact, we also observe phage-mediated differential expression caused by phage-specific stresses and molecular mechanisms. These responses suggest the presence of a conserved Bacterial Adaptive Phage Response mechanism as a novel type of host defense mechanism, and which may explain transient forms of phage persistence. Overall design: Four Phage negative control samples are compared to seven samples representing phage LUZ19, eight samples representing phage YuA, three samples representing phage PEV2, and seven samples representing phage 14-1.	eSequencing	Comparative transcriptomics reveals a conserved Bacterial Adaptive Phage Response (BAPR) to viral predation	eWhole	eTranscriptome	eMultiisolate	Comparative transcriptomics reveals a conserved Bacterial Adaptive Phage Response (BAPR) to viral predation			287	287	eBacteria	2018-01-18		2018-01-19		KU Leuven

363	415714	PRJNA415714	Transcriptome or Gene expression	RNAs are well-suited to act as cellular sensors that detect and respond to metabolite changes in the environment due to their ability to fold into complex structures. Here, we introduce a genome-wide strategy called PARCEL that experimentally identifies RNA aptamers in vitro, in a high-throughput manner. By applying PARCEL to a collection of prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms, we have revealed 58 new RNA aptamers to three key metabolites, greatly expanding the list of natural RNA aptamers. The newly identified RNA aptamers exhibit significant sequence conservation, are highly structured and show an unexpected prevalence in coding regions.

371	414086	PRJNA414086	raw sequence reads	Chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections evades antibiotic therapy and are associated with mortality in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. We find that in vitro resistance evolution of P.aeruginosa towards clinically relevant antibiotics leads to phenotypic convergence towards distinct states. These states are associated with collateral sensitivity towards several antibiotic classes and encoded by mutations in antibiotic resistance genes, including transcriptional regulator nfxB. Longitudinal analysis of isolates from CF patients reveals similar defined phenotypic states, which are associated with extinction of specific sub-lineages in patients. In depth investigation of chronic P.aeruginosa populations in a CF patient during antibiotic therapy revealed dramatic genotypic and phenotypic convergence. Notably, fluoroquinolone-resistant subpopulations harboring nfxB mutations were eradicated by antibiotic therapy as predicted by our in vitro data. This study supports the hypothesis that antibiotic treatment of chronic infections can be optimized by targeting phenotypic states associated with specific mutations to improve treatment success in chronic infections.	eSequencing		eWhole	eGenome	eMultispecies	Drug-driven phenotypic convergence supports rational treatment strategies of chronic infections						2017-10-12		2017-10-12	yes	Technical University of Denmark
372	413896	PRJEB22593	Other	Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen that can thrive by anaerobic respiration in the lungs of cystic fibrosis patients using nitrate as terminal electron acceptor. Here, we report the identification and characterization of the small RNA PaiI in the P. aeruginosa strain 14 (PA14). PaiI is anaerobically induced in the presence of nitrate and depends on the two-component system NarXL. The sRNA is stable during anaerobiosis and rapidly degraded in the presence of oxygen. Our studies further revealed that PaiI is required for efficient denitrification affecting the conversion of nitrite to nitric oxide. In the absence of PaiI anaerobic growth was impaired on glucose as the sole carbon source. This phenotype was suppressed by overproduction of the transcriptional regulator Dnr, which is required for transcription of genes encoding the denitrification machinery. The importance of PaiI for anaerobic growth was further underlined by the observation that a paiI deletion mutant displayed an impaired growth in the hypoxic/anaerobic necrotic centers of transplanted subcutaneous mouse tumors. This data are discussed in terms of a model wherein PaiI either directly or indirectly impacts on the denitrification pathway.	eSequencing	PA14: sRNA PaiI	eWhole	eGenome	eMonoisolate	The anaerobically induced sRNA PaiI affects denitrification in Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA14						2017-10-11		2017-10-11		UNIVERSITY OF VIENNA

403	393549	PRJEB20763	Other	Pseudomonas aeruginosa chronic infections of cystic fibrosis (CF) airways are a paradigm for within-host evolution with abundant evidence for rapid evolutionary adaptation and diversification. Recently emerged transmissible strains have spread globally, with the Liverpool Epidemic Strain (LES) the most common strain infecting the UK CF population. However, despite its clinical importance, little is known about the impact of transmissibility on the genetic structure of these infections over time. To characterise this, we longitudinally sampled a meta-population of 15 LES lineages over 13 months among seven chronically infected CF patients by genome sequencing. Comparative genome analyses of P. aeruginosa populations revealed highly dynamic within-patient population genetic structure, including shifts in the relative abundance of lineages and rapid replacement of dominant lineages, likely to represent super-infection of diverged lineages by repeated transmissions. Lineage dynamics within patients led to rapid changes in the frequencies of mutations across suites of linked loci carried by each lineage. Many of these loci were associated with important infection phenotypes such as antibiotic resistance, mucoidy and quorum sensing, and were repeatedly and independently mutated in different lineages. These findings suggest that transmissibility leads to rapid shifts in the genetic structure of CF infections, including in clinically important phenotypes, and is likely to impede accurate diagnosis and treatment.	eSequencing	Genetic dynamics of Pseudomonas infections	eWhole	eGenome	eMonoisolate	Dynamic genetic structure of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in transmissible chronic infections of cystic fibrosis airways						2017-07-09		2017-07-09		LIV

Guidance does not specify which typing technique is most practical or useful for infection prevention and control team (IPCT) to base their decisions on. We aim to provide new insight into the usefulness for the IPCT of using whole genome sequencing (WGS) in the investigation of a suspected Pseudomonas aeruginosa outbreak in an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and describe how it compares with current typing methods such as pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) analysis. Samples from ICU patients found to have P.aeruginosa underwent VNTR typing and PFGE. Genomic libraries were prepared by Nextera XT (Illumina). WGS was performed using an Illumia MiSeq platform. When routine typing methods were used, both VNTR and PFGE were required to fully determine the potential source of infection and rule out others. WGS provided clarity and unambiguously distinguished the linked isolates this gave the IPCT greater assurance of the transmission route between wash hand basin (WHB) water and two patients supporting the infection prevention and control measures employed. WGS provided detailed information negating the need for further typing. When this data is allied to epidemiological information it can be used by IPCT to understand outbreak situations rapidly and with more certainty. Implementation of this technique in real time would be a major advance in their day-to-day practice and could become a standard of care as it becomes more widespread, portable and reproducible.	eSequencing	Pseudomonas aeruginosa outbreak study	eWhole	eGenome	eMonoisolate	With this study we aim to provide new insight into the usefulness for the infection prevention and control team of using whole genome sequencing in the investigation of a suspected Pseudomonas aeruginosa outbreak in an Intensive Care Unit and describe how it compares with current typing methods such as pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and variable number tandem repeat analysis.						2017-07-02		2017-07-02		University St Andrews
406	392741	PRJEB15059	Other	Antibiotic resistance constitutes one of the most serious threats to the global public health and it urgently requires new and effective solutions. Bacteriophages are bacterial viruses increasingly recognized as being good alternatives to the traditional antibiotic therapies. In the present study, the efficacy of phages against Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 biofilm and planktonic cell cultures was evaluated over the course of 48 h. Although significant reductions in the number of viable cells were achieved for both cases, the high level of adaptability of the bacteria in response to the selective pressure caused by phage treatment resulted in the emergence of phage-resistant variants. In this work, the emergence of phage-resistant variants was tracked during phage infection experiments, in which the phages were targeting different cell receptors. Resistant bacterial variants were isolated as early as 6-h post-phage biofilm treatment, depending on the phage used. In most cases, the emergence of phage-resistant variants occurred at a later time point in planktonic cultures than in biofilms. To further investigate the genetic makeup of these phage-resistant variants and possible mutations accumulated, some of these bacteria were selected for further phenotypic and genotypic characterization. Whole genome sequencing was performed on five of the P. aeruginosa PAO1-derived phage-resistant variants and all of them carried mutations affecting the galU gene, which is involved in lipopolysaccharide core biosynthesis, as well as in one of pil genes, which are involved in the synthesis of type IV pilus. These results were corroborated by results from the LPS analysis of the five variants, which revealed defects in LPS biosynthesis as reflected by the presence of truncated core oligosaccharide and the absence of long-chain O-antigen bands. Examination of these variants by transmission electron microscopy, revealed that in contrast to the wild-type bacteria, none of the variants produces pili . Genomic sequencing further revealed that three of the P. aeruginosa PAO1 variants carry large deletions (> 200 kbp) in their genomes. Overall, this work demonstrates that P. aeruginosa biofilms can survive phage attack and develops phage-resistant variants that are well adapted to the biofilm mode of growth.	eSequencing	P. aeruginosa phage resistance	eWhole	eGenome	eMonoisolate	Emergence of phage-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm cells in response to the pressure exerted by bacteriophage treatment						2017-07-01		2017-07-01		KIT
407	392234	PRJNA392234	Genome sequencing and assembly	P. aeruginosa is a ubiquitous organism found in nearly all environments, including different types of soil and water, and plants. Although the bacteria can be an opportunistic pathogen of human and animals, the bacterium is mostly harmless under normal conditions. The use of antibiotics in modern medicine, however, enabled the highly adaptive bacterium to invade new niches, evolving into one of the most important hospital-acquired infections in the country. In this project, we are investigating the link between strains of the bacterium isolated from the environment and from clinical settings.	eSequencing		eWhole	eGenome	eMultispecies	Genomic diversity of environmental Pseudomonas aeruginosa						2017-06-28		2017-06-28		Bard College
408	392168	PRJNA392168	raw sequence reads	During environmental adaptation bacteria use small regulatory RNAs (sRNAs) to repress or activate translation of a large fraction of their proteome. Using a modification of the in vivo RNA proximity ligation method, we probed global sRNA interactions with their targets in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We identified two sRNAs (Sr0161 and ErsA) that interact with the mRNA encoding the major porin OprD responsible for the uptake of carbapenem antibiotics. These two sRNAs base-pair with the 5’ UTR of oprD and prevent initiation of translation, resulting in an increase in resistance of the bacteria to meropenem. Additional proximity ligation experiments and enrichment for Sr0161 targets identified the mRNA for the regulator of type III secretion system. Interaction between the exsA mRNA and Sr0161 lead to a block in the synthesis of a component of the T3SS apparatus and an effector. Another sRNA, Sr006, positively regulates, without Hfq, the expression of PagL, an enzyme responsible for deacylation of lipid A thus reducing its pro-inflammatory property and resulting in polymyxin resistance. Collectively, our work shows that an analysis of global sRNA-mRNA interactions can lead to discoveries of novel pathways controlling gene expression that are likely integrated into larger regulatory networks.	eSequencing		eWhole	eGenome	eMultispecies	Hi-GRIL-Seq: Probing the sRNA regulatory landscape of P. aeruginosa: post-transcriptional control of determinants of pathogenicity and antibiotic susceptibility;System and Methods for Analysis of Bacterial Transcriptomes;Regulation of P. aeruginosa fitness by small non-coding RNAs						2017-06-27		2017-06-27		Wellesley College

411	391260	PRJNA391260	Transcriptome or Gene expression	Purpose: Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). We provide an insight to the DNA auxotrophy of P. aeruginosa PASS4 isolate. Better understanding of P. aeruginosa adaptations in the CF lung environment can have a great impact in the development of specialised treatment regimes aimed at the eradications of P. aeruginosa infections. Methods: P. aeruginosa strains PAO1 and PASS4 were grown in minimal medium with either L-Asparagine or DNA as a carbon source, in biological triplicates. RNA was extracted and sequenced on Illumina HiSeq 1000 platform. The sequence reads that passed quality filters were analyzed using EdgePro and DESeq packages, as well as the Rockhopper tool. Results: We mapped > 10 million paired sequence reads per sample to the genome of P. aeruginosa PAO1 and identified a total of 576 genes differentially expressed by PASS4 when grown in DNA (P value < 0.01, log2 fold-change 1< to < -1), with 322 genes upregulated and 254 genes downregulated. There were a total of 423 genes differentially expressed by PAO1 when grown in DNA (P value < 0.01, log2 fold-change 1< to <-1), with 359 genes upregulated and 64 genes downregulated . A total of 129 transcripts displayed similar expression patterns in both organisms, with 112 being upregulated and 17 down-regulated. Conclusions: Our study identified that P. aeruginosa PASS4 was a purine auxotroph. Purine auxotropy may represent a viable microbial strategy for adaptation to DNA rich environments such as the CF lung. Overall design: mRNA profiles of P. aeruginosa strains PAO1 and PASS4 grown in minimal media with either DNA or L-Asparagine as a sole carbon source were generated by paired end sequencing, in triplicate, using Illumina HiSeq.	eSequencing	Pseudomonas aeruginosa	eWhole	eTranscriptome	eMultiisolate	A Cystic Fibrosis Pseudomonas aeruginosa Isolate Specialised to Catabolise Nucleic Acids			287	287	eBacteria	2017-06-21		2019-06-24		Mcquarie University	ePublished	2019-06-20T00:00:00Z	31214142	ePubmed

We find that intermittent antibiotic treatment leads to the evolution of cost-free resistance, and demonstrate that compensatory evolution is the mechanism responsible for cost-free resistance. Our results suggest that discontinuous administration of antibiotic may be contributing to the high levels of antibiotic resistance currently found worldwide.	eSequencing	Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA14	eWhole	eGenome	eMonoisolate	Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA14 Raw sequence reads		Pa14	652611	287	eBacteria	2017-06-20		2017-06-20		University of Ottawa

415	390267	PRJNA390267	Transcriptome or Gene expression	Purpose: The intensive use of metal-based nanoparticles results in their continuous release into the environment and the subsequent destroying microbial biodiversity and causing occurrence of antibiotic resistant determinants. Although previous studies have indicated that nanoparticles may be toxic to microorganisms, there is a scarcity of data available to assess the underlying molecular mechanisms of inhibitory and biocidal effects of nanoparticles on microorganisms, which is a critical gap in our comprehensive understanding of the impacts of nanoparticles on microbial ecosystems. Methods: By combining the global activated/suppressed gene profiles and detected physiological responses, we detected the microbial response to CuO NPs exposure and revealed potential mechanisms of CuO NPs on this prevalent opportunistic pathogen and environmentally relevant denitrifier. Results:Our results indicate that nanoparticles could react directly with the biological membrane, but also change gene expressions. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) results indicate that CuO nanoparticles not only damaged the structure of the bacterial membrane but also entered the cells. Planktonic cells of P. aeruginosa are energetically compromised after exposure to a sublethal level (1 and 10 mg/L) of CuO nanoparticles. Respiration was likely inhibited as denitrification activity was severely depleted in terms of decreased transcript levels of most denitrification genes. In addition, and of high concern, bacteriophage genes were activated and it is speculated that phage mediated cell lysis. Meanwhile, CuO NP exposure induced significantly up-regulated expressions of metal resistance gene, resistance-nodulation-division, P-type ATPase efflux and cation diffusion facilitator transporters, which can form an integrated network controlling metals concentrations in the cytoplasm and periplasm P. aeruginosa. Conclusion: Based on our results, it is evident that the response of bacteria under the exposure of nanoparticles is very complex, though a clear and comprehensive understanding of the true mechanisms of inhibition or toxicity is still lacking. Our findings will provide insights on whole picture regarding the fundamental mechanisms of microbial susceptibility, tolerance and resistance to exposure of CuO NPs, as well highlight to re-estimate potential risks of CuO NP to public health and environment. Overall design: mRNA profiles of P.aeruginosa PAO1 towards CuO NPs stress were generated by next generation sequencing via Illumina 2000.	eSequencing	Pseudomonas aeruginosa	eWhole	eTranscriptome	eMultiisolate	Next generation sequencing of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 in the presence of Copper Nanoparticles Stress			287	287	eBacteria	2017-06-13		2017-12-31		Advanced Water Management Centre, University of Queensland

417	389442	PRJNA389442	Transcriptome or Gene expression	In this study we have profiled a clinical tobramycin resistant P. aeruginosa strain that exhibited a small colony variant (SCV) phenotype. Both, the resistance and the colony morphology phenotypes were lost upon passaging the isolate under rich medium conditions. Transcriptional and mutational profiling revealed that the SCV harbored activating mutations in the two two-component systems AmgRS and PmrAB. Introduction of these mutations singularly into the type strain PA14 conferred tobramycin and colistin resistance, respectively. However, their combined introduction had an additive effect on the tobramycin resistance phenotype. Activation of the AmgRS system slightly reduced the colony size of the PA14 wild-type, whereas the simultaneous overexpression of gacA, the response regulator of the GacSA two component system, further reduced colony size. In conclusion, we uncovered combinatorial influences of two-component systems on clinically relevant phenotypes, such as resistance and the expression of the SCV phenotype. Our results clearly demonstrate that combined activation of P. aeruginosa two-component systems exhibit pleiotropic effects with unforeseen consequences.

426	384725	PRJNA384725	Transcriptome or Gene expression	The PA0336 protein from Pseudomonas aeruginosa belongs to the family of widely distributed Nudix pyrophosphohydrolases which catalyze the hydrolysis of pyrophosphate bonds in a variety of nucleoside diphosphate derivatives. The amino acid sequence of the PA0336 protein is highly similar to that of the RppH Nudix RNA pyrophosphohydrolase from E. coli which removes pyrophosphate from 5’-end of triphosphorylated RNA transcripts. Trans-complementation experiments showed that the P. aeruginosa enzyme can functionally substitute for RppH in E. coli cells indicating that, similarly to RppH, the Pseudomonas hydrolase mediates RNA turnover in vivo. In order to elucidate the biological significance of the PA0336 protein in Pseudomonas cells, a PA0336 mutant strain was constructed. The mutated strain considerably increased level of the virulence factor pyocyanin compared to wild type, suggesting that PA0336 could be involved in down-regulation of P. aeruginosa pathogenicity. This phenotype was reversed by complementation with the wild type, but not catalytically inactive PA0336, indicating that the catalytic activity was indispensable for its biological function. To study the role of PA0336 further, transcriptomes of the PA0336 mutant and the wild type strain were compared using RNA sequencing. The cellular level of a number of transcripts was affected by the lack of PA0336. We focused our attention on pathogenesis-related genes. Up-regulated in the PA0336 mutant were transcripts coding for, i. a., proteins involved in the regulation and/or production of pyocyanin, biofim-associated alginates and exotoxins. The results from the global analysis were verified by determining the cellular level of chosen transcripts by quantitative RT-PCR method. Pathogenesis tests in Caenorhabditis elegans showed that the PA0336 mutant of P. aeruginosa was significantly more virulent than the parental strain, confirming further that the P. aeruginosa RNA pyrophosphohydrolase PA0336 modulates bacterial pathogenesis by down-regulating production of virulence factors.

434	381683	PRJNA381683	transcriptome	Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a leading causative agent in nosocomial infections, which is attributed to its ability to form robust biofilms and engage a series of virulence mechanisms. Cyclic-di-GMP (c-di-GMP), a secondary messenger found in most bacterial species, is well known to regulate P. aeruginosa biofilm formation. High intracellular c-di-GMP content enhances biofilm formation, while a reduction of the c-di-GMP content in biofilm cells leads to biofilm dispersal. It remains unclear how biofilm dispersal through c-di-GMP reduction will ‘prepare’ the dispersed cells for their subsequent planktonic lifestyle. Here, we show that cells with high and low intracellular c-di-GMP contents have distinct transcriptome profiles. Interestingly, quorum-sensing (QS)-controlled virulence factors such as rhamnolipids and pyocyanin were found to be highly expressed in cells with low intracellular c-di-GMP content compared to cells with higher c-di-GMP content. This correlates well with their intracellular survival rates and cytotoxicity after in vitro exposure to murine macrophages. Our data suggests that biofilm dispersal through c-di-GMP manipulation might induce QS-regulated virulence during infections.	eSequencing	Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 strain:PA01	eWhole	eTranscriptome	eMonoisolate	Reducing intracellular c-di-GMP content increases quorum sensing-regulated virulence in Pseudomonas aeruginosa		PA01	208964	287	eBacteria	2017-04-05		2017-04-05		SCELSE

439	379927	PRJEB20060	Other	There is an urgent need to develop novel approaches for predicting and preventing the evolution of antibiotic resistance. Here we show that strains of Pseudomonas evolve de novo resistance to a clinically important β-lactam antibiotic, ceftazidime, at very different rates. This variation arises because strains possessing the ampR global transcriptional regulator evolve resistance at a high rate. This does not arise because of mutations in ampR. Instead, this regulator potentiates evolution by allowing mutations in conserved peptidoglycan biosynthesis genes to induce high levels of β-lactamase expression. Crucially, blocking this evolutionary pathway by co-administering ceftazidime with the β-lactamase inhibitor avibactam can be used to eliminate pathogenic P. aeruginosa populations before they can evolve resistance. In summary, our study shows that identifying potentiator genes that act as evolutionary catalysts can be used to both predict and prevent the evolution of antibiotic resistance.	eSequencing	Identifying and exploiting genes that potentiate the evolution of antibiotic resistance	eWhole	eGenome	eMonoisolate	Whole genome sequences of 8 Pseudomonas strains selected for resistance to ceftazidime						2017-03-21		2017-03-21		UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD

459	368955	PRJNA368955	Other	Pseudomonads typically carry multiple non-identical alleles of the post-transcriptional regulator rsmA. In P. aeruginosa, RsmN is notable in that its structural rearrangement confers distinct and overlapping functions with RsmA. However, little is known about the specificities RsmN for its target RNAs and overall impact on the biology of this pathogen. We purified and mapped 503 transcripts directly bound by RsmN in P. aeruginosa. About 200 of the mRNAs identified encode proteins of demonstrated function including some determining acute and chronic virulence traits. For example, RsmN reduces biofilm development both directly and indirectly via multiple pathways, involving control of Pel exopolysaccharide biosynthesis and c-di-GMP levels. The RsmN targets identified are also shared with RsmA, although deletion of rsmN generally results in less pronounced phenotypes than those observed for rsmA or rsmAN mutants, probably as a consequence of different binding affinities. New targets for the Rsm system, previously masked by the presence of RsmN were identified. These include the small non-coding RNA CrcZ involved in carbon catabolite repression, for which differential binding of the two proteins to specific CrcZ target sequences is demonstrated. The results presented here provide new insights into the intricacy of riboregulatory networks involving multiple but distinct RsmA homologues. Overall design: To identify direct RsmN targets in P. aeruginosa and genes that are post-transcriptionally regulated by RsmN through interaction with their corresponding transcripts, RsmN was expressed in strain PAO1-L and co-purified with its binding RNAs. These were extracted and subjected to RNASeq to characterize the RsmN regulon under the growth conditions used. Total RNA was also extracted from the same culture samples to determine specific RNA abundances and to compare these to those of the RsmN-bound fractions as enrichment ratios. Applying a stringent 3.5-fold minimum enrichment cut-off, a total of 503 transcripts was identified as transcripts bound by RsmN, several of which were experimentally validated. The Preliminary data set is of two conditions, total RNA and RsmN-bound RNA both in duplicate. The final study is of the same two conditions but in triplicate.	eOther	Pseudomonas aeruginosa	eWhole	eOther	eMultiisolate	Genome-wide mapping of the RNA targets of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa riboregulatory protein RsmN			287	287	eBacteria	2017-01-26		2019-05-21		University of Nottingham	ePublished	2018-05-03T00:00:00Z	29718466	ePubmed

We have isolated from hospital waste water a novel Pseudomonas aeruginosa levivirus, vB_PaeL_PcyII-10_LeviOr01. Its size is 3669 nucleotides and it encodes four putative proteins. Following bacterial infection, a carrier state is established in a fraction of cells conferring superinfection immunity and favoring the emergence of type IV pilus receptor mutants, but also of mutations affecting LPS biosynthesis. The study hosts whole genome sequence from the levivirus, the sequencing reads used to assemble the sequence, and sequencing reads from four P. aeruginosa strain PcyII-10 colonies carrying the virus.	eSequencing	ssRNA levivirus LeviOr01 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa PcyII-10 carrier strains	eWhole	eGenome	eMonoisolate	Phage LeviOr01 ssRNA levivirus genome and sequence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PcyII-10 carrier variants						2017-01-26		2017-01-26		INSTITUT DE GENETIQUE ET MICROBIOLOGIE			28771128	ePubmed
461	368826	PRJEB18612	Other	PcyII-10 is a clinical strain recovered from a burn patient in Percy hospital, Clamart, France. Bacteria and their bacteriophages coexist and coevolve for the benefit of both in a mutualistic association. Multiple mechanisms are used by bacteria to resist phages in a trade-off between survival and maintenance of fitness. In vitro studies allow inquiring into the fate of virus and host in different conditions aimed at mimicking natural environment. We analyse here the mutations emerging in a clinical Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain in response to infection by Ab09, a N4-like lytic podovirus and describe a variety of chromosomal deletions and mutations conferring resistance. Some deletions result from illegitimate recombination taking place during long-term maintenance of the phage genome. Phage variants with mutation in a tail fiber gene are selected during pseudolysogeny with the capacity to infect resistant cells and produce large plaques. These results highlight the complex host/phage association and suggest that phage Ab09 promotes bacterial chromosome rearrangements. Finally this study uncovered the essential role of two bacterial genes in Ab09 phage adhesion to the cell, rpsB encoding protein S2 of the 30S ribosomal subunit and ORF1587 encoding a Wzy-like membrane protein involved in LPS biosynthesis.	eSequencing	Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain PcyII-10 and phage-resistant variants	eWhole	eGenome	eMonoisolate	Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain PcyII-10 whole genome sequence and PcyII-10 variants resisting infection by N4-like phage Ab09						2017-01-26		2017-01-26		INSTITUT DE GENETIQUE ET MICROBIOLOGIE

463	361588	PRJEB17615	Other	The challenges facing public health microbiologists when tackling pathogenic microbial species can be broadly summarised as 1) identification of high-risk lineages, 2) their risk assessment (eg., antimicrobial resistance) and 3) infection control. Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) of bacterial species provides signatures of resistance and virulence and, uniquely, allows the build up of a ‘digital library’ for ongoing population comparison, which can be utilised to identify markers for rapid diagnostics. We will facilitate the implementation of WGS within AMR surveillance and clinical diagnostics within the laboratory network of the Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance Program (ARSP) in the Philippines, and develop bioinformatics to enable local, national and international comparison of data for key pathogen species . The proposal consists of 4 major parts: 1)Establishment of genomic background – sequencing of retrospective susceptible and resistant isolates (to be undertaken at The Sanger Institute). 2)Prospective sequencing (within ARSRL) – isolates with novel antibiograms determined by routine susceptibility testing via a ‘save for sequencing’ flag within the WHONET software (in use currently). 3)Provision of data throughout the ARSP network using tools developed at Sanger and Imperial College 4)Capacity building in genomics, bioinformatics and sequencing (staff exchange between locations and workshops).	eSequencing	_See_and_Sequence____Genomic_surveillance_of_antimicrobial_resistant_and_high_risk_pathogenic_clones_within_the_Philippines_	eWhole	eGenome	eMonoisolate	_See_and_Sequence____Genomic_surveillance_of_antimicrobial_resistant_and_high_risk_pathogenic_clones_within_the_Philippines_						2017-01-17		2017-01-17		SC

468	358496	PRJEB12456	Other	Phenotypic change is a hallmark of bacterial adaptation during chronic infection. In the case of chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa lung infection in patients with cystic fibrosis, well-characterised phenotypic variants include mucoid and small colony variants (SCVs). Here we show that P. aeruginosa SCVs can be reproducibly isolated from the murine lung following the establishment of chronic infection. Using a combination of single-molecule real-time (PacBio) and Illumina sequencing we identified the genetic switch for conversion to the SCV phenotype as a large genomic inversion through recombination between homologous regions of two rRNA operons. This phenotypic conversion was associated with large-scale transcriptional changes distributed through the genome. This global rewiring of the cellular transcriptomic output results changes to normally differentially regulated genes that modulate resistance to oxidative stress, central metabolism and virulence. These changes are of clinical relevance since the appearance of SCVs during chronic infection is associated with declining lung function	eSequencing	Genomic inversion drives small colony variant formation and increased virulence in P. aeruginosa	eWhole	eGenome	eMonoisolate	Genomic inversion drives small colony variant formation and increased virulence in P. aeruginosa						2016-12-22		2016-12-22		UNIVERSITY OF GLASGOW
469	355665	PRJEB17843	Other	Cooperation in nature is ubiquitous, but is susceptible to social cheats who pay little or no cost of cooperation yet reap the benefits. The effect such cheats have on reducing population productivity suggests that there is selection for cooperators to mitigate the adverse effects of cheats. While mechanisms have been elucidated for scenarios involving a direct association between producer and cooperative product, it remains unclear whether cooperators can suppress cheating in an anonymous public goods scenario, whereby cheats cannot be directly identified. Here, we investigate the real-time evolutionary response of cooperators to cheats when cooperation is mediated by a diffusible public good; the production of iron-scavenging siderophores by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We find that siderophore-producing cooperators evolved in the presence of a high frequency of non-producing cheats become more resilient to cheating by evolving reduced siderophore production, at no obvious cost to population productivity. Novel morphotypes, appeared independently in 5/6 cheat-adapted populations, exhibiting increased and reduced production of the toxin pyocyanin and the siderophore pyoverdine, respectively. These morphotypes were characterised by large deletions in lasR and rsaL genes. Finally, we demonstrate that the iron-reducing capabilities of pyocyanin may have contributed to the prevalence of these novel morphotypes in cheat-adapted populations.	eSequencing	Bacterial adaptation to public goods cheats	eWhole	eGenome	eMonoisolate	Adaptation to public goods cheats in Pseudomonas aeruginosa						2016-12-01		2016-12-01		LIV

The potential importance of these “public goods” in bacterial evolutionary ecology has been extensively studied. Cheating by siderophore-null mutants of the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa has received particular attention. The potential of siderophore mutants to attenuate virulence, and the possibility of exploiting this for clinical ends, have generated a wealth of publications. However, the possibility that genotype  environment interactions govern the evolutionary consequences of siderophore loss has been almost entirely ignored. A literature review revealed (i) widespread use of an undefined mutant as a siderophore cheat; and (ii) a reliance on experiments conducted in iron-limited minimal medium. Whole genome sequencing of the undefined mutant revealed a range of mutations affecting phenotypes other than siderophore production. We then conducted cheating assays using clean deletion mutants, grown in conditions designed to model infected fluids and tissue in cystic fibrosis lung infection and non-healing wounds. Depending on the environment, we found that siderophore loss could lead to cheating, simple fitness defects, or no fitness effect at all. It is therefore crucial to develop appropriate in vitro growth conditions before attempting to predict social evolution in vivo.	eSequencing	Pseudomonas siderophores	eWhole	eGenome	eMonoisolate	This project tested if siderophores are publig goods in Pseudomonas, and involved resequencing a well used siderophore mutant made by non-specific mutagenesis techniques						2016-11-11		2016-11-11		UoB_McNally

476	349811	PRJNA349811	raw sequence reads	The first step in the post-transcriptional regulatory function of most bacterial small non-coding RNAs (sRNAs) is base-pairing with partially complementary sequences of targeted transcripts. We present a simple, yet robust method for identifying sRNA targets in vivo and defining processing sites of the regulated transcripts. The technique (referred to as GRIL-Seq) is based on preferential ligation of sRNAs to the ends of base-paired targets in bacteria expressing the T4 RNA ligase followed by sequencing to identify the ligated chimeras. In addition to the RNA chaperone Hfq, the GRIL-Seq method depends on the activity of the pyrophoshorylase RppH. We used PrrF1, an iron-regulated sRNA in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, to demonstrate that direct regulatory targets of this sRNA can be readily identified. Therefore, GRIL-Seq represents a powerful tool not only for identifying direct targets of sRNAs in a variety of environments, but also for better understanding the mechanistic details of their activity during post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression.	eSequencing		eWhole	eGenome	eMultispecies	GRIL-Seq: a method for identifying direct targets of bacterial small regulatory RNA by in vivo proximity ligation;System and Methods for Analysis of Bacterial Transcriptomes;P. aeruginosa Virulence Determinants						2016-10-21		2016-10-21		Wellesley College

482	347746	PRJEB14922	Other	Bacteriophage vB_PaeP_PAO1_phiC725A (short name phiC725A) was isolated following mitomycin C induction of C7-25, a clinical Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain carrying Pf725A as a prophage. The Pf725A genome sequence shows similarity to F116, a P. aeruginosa phage capable of generalized transduction. Similarly to F116, phiC725A is a podovirus with long tail fibers. phiC725A was able to lysogenize two additional P. aeruginosa strains in which it was maintained both as a prophage and in an episomal state. Investigation by deep sequencing showed that bacterial DNA carried inside phage particles originated predominantly from a 800kb region, immediately flanking the attL prophage insertion site, whether the phages were induced from a lysogen or recovered after infection. This indicates that during productive replication, occasional recombination of phage genomes with the bacterial chromosome at the att site occurs, allowing packaging of adjacent bacterial DNA.	eSequencing	Biased generalised transduction by F116likevirus in Pseudomonas aeruginosa	eWhole	eGenome	eMonoisolate	Large preferential Site for packaging of bacterial DNA by phiC725A, a new Pseudomonas aeruginosa F116-like bacteriophage						2016-10-11		2016-10-11		INSTITUT DE GENETIQUE ET MICROBIOLOGIE			28060939	ePubmed
483	347742	PRJEB12851	Other	Saltoviruses, of which the Escherichia coli phage Mu is the reference, are temperate phages that multiply their genome through replicative transposition at multiple sites in their host chromosome. The viral genome is packaged together with host DNA at both ends. In the first associated work, genome sequencing of three Pseudomonas aeruginosa saltoviruses, HW12, 2P1 and Ab30, incidentally gave us access to the location of thousands of replicative integration sites and revealed the existence of a variable number of hotspots. Taking advantage of deep sequencing, an experiment was designed to study 13,000,000 transposon integration sites of bacteriophage Ab30. The investigation revealed the presence of 42 transposition hotspots adjacent to bacterial interspersed mosaic elements (BIME) accounting for 5% of all transposition sites. The rest of the sites appeared widely distributed with the exception of cold spots associated with low G-C content segments, including the putative O-antigen biosynthesis cluster. Surprisingly, 0.4% of the transposition events occurred in a copy of the phage genome itself, indicating that the previously described immunity against such events is slightly leaky. This observation allowed drawing an image of the phage chromosome supercoiling into four loops.	eSequencing	The Variety of Transposition Behaviors Revealed by the High-Resolution Description of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa Saltovirus Integration Sites	eWhole	eGenome	eMonoisolate	The Variety of Transposition Behaviors Revealed by the High-Resolution Description of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa Saltovirus Integration Sites						2016-10-11		2016-10-11		INSTITUT DE GENETIQUE ET MICROBIOLOGIE

485	344987	PRJEB15036	Other	For this purpose, a total of eighteen ST175 isolates recovered from 8 different Spanish hospitals were analyzed; four isolates from four different French hospitals were included also for comparison. The typical resistance profile of ST175 included penicillins, cephalosporins, monobactams, carbapenems, aminoglycosides (gentamicin and tobramycin), and fluoroquinolones. In the phylogenetic analysis, the four French isolates clustered together with the two isolates from one of the Spanish regions. Sequence variation was further analyzed for 146 genes previously related to antimicrobial resistance using PAO1 genome as reference. The presence of horizontally-acquired resistance determinants was explored using Resfinder. The resistome of ST175 was found to be mainly determined by mutational events, with resistance traits common all or nearly all of the strains regardless of the place of isolation, including specific ampR mutations leading to ampC overexpression, specific mutations in oprD conferring carbapenem resistance or a mexZ mutation leading to MexXY overexpression. All isolates additionally harbored an aadB gene conferring gentamicin and tobramycin resistance. Several other resistance traits were specific to certain geographic areas such as a streptomycin resistance aadA13 gene detected in all four isolates from France and in the 2 isolates from the Cantabria region or a glpT mutation conferring fosfomycin resistance precisely detected in all but the six isolates with aadA13. Finally, several unique resistance mutations were detected in single isolates, particularly interesting among them the mutations detected in genes encoding PBPs (PBP1A, PBP3 and PBP4). Thus, these results provide valuable information for understanding both, the genetic basis of resistance and the dynamics of dissemination and evolution of MDR/XDR high-risk clones.	eSequencing	Deciphering the resistome of the widespread extensively drug resistant (XDR) P. aeruginosa ST175 clone.	eWhole	eGenome	eMonoisolate	Whole genome sequencing (WGS) was used for the characterization of the phylogeny, the molecular epidemiology and the resistome of the multidrug resistant (MDR)/ extensively drug resistant (XDR) P. aeruginosa high-risk clone ST175.						2016-09-30		2016-09-30		Institut d'Investigacio Sanitaria de Palma

490	343734	PRJNA343734	Epigenomics	Pseudomonas aeruginosa possesses at least three well-defined quorum-sensing (QS) (las, rhl, and pqs) systems. These QS systems control a variety of important functions including virulence. RsaL is a QS repressor that reduces QS signal production and ensures homeostasis by functioning in opposition to LasR. However, its regulatory role in signal homeostasis remains elusive. Here, we conducted a ChIP-seq assay and revealed that RsaL bound to two new targets, the intergenic regions of PA2228/PA2229 and pqsH/cdpR, which are required for PQS synthesis. Deletion of rsaL reduced the transcription of pqsH and cdpR, thus decreasing PQS signal production. The ΔrsaL strain exhibited increased pyocyanin production and reduced biofilm formation, which are dependent on CdpR or PqsH activity. In addition, we solved the structure of the RsaL-DNA complex at a 2.4 Å resolution. Although the overall sequence similarity is quite low, RsaL folds into a HTH-like structure, which is conserved among many transcriptional regulators. Complementation results of the rsaL knockout cells with different rsaL mutants further confirmed the critical role of the DNA-binding residues (including Arg20, Gln27, Gln38, Gly35, Ser37, and Ser42) that are essential for DNA binding. Our findings reveal new targets of RsaL and provide insight into the detailed characterization of the RsaL-DNA interaction.

500	340943	PRJNA340943	Transcriptome or Gene expression	Purpose: Recently we have characterize 43 clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa overproducing the efflux pump MexEF-OprN. About 45% of these strains did not display mutations in any of the regulators known to control mexEF-oprN expression. Here we identified a novel regulator of the efflux operon mexEF-oprN that we named CmrA by characterizing in vitro selected mutants from the strain PA14. Methods: MexEF-OprN overproducing spontaneous mutants were selected in vitro using the reference strain PA14 in presence of chloramphenicol. Selected mutants (PJ mutants) were characterized using different criteria such as antibiotic susceptibility and production of virulence traits. Gene expression was evaluated by RT-qPCR. Whole genome sequencing of selected mutants (PJ mutants) was performed using IonTorrent technology. Knock-out mutants were constructed by overlapping PCR and homologous recombination. Finally, a transcriptomic analysis by RNAseq was performed to identify the genes depending on CmrA. Results: Characterization of the 4 selected PJ mutants showed that these strains have resistance and virulence profiles slightly differentent from those typically observed in MexEF-OprN overproducing strains (mexS- NfxC strains). The cmrA+ strains (here called NfxC2) showed moderate resistance to MexEF-OprN antibiotic substrates (ciprofloxacin, chloramphenicol and trimethoprim from 8- to 32-fold compared to PA14) and showed a less compromised capacity to produce some virulence traits (rhamnolipids, elastase, biofilm and pyocyanin) as well as the swarming motility. Whole genome sequencing of PJ mutants led to the identification of SNPs in the gene PA14_38040 (PA14_RS15465 after 2015 genome annotation uptdate). The gene PA14_RS15465 codes for an unknown transcriptional activator and was named cmrA for chlormaphenicol resistance activator. Aminoacid substitutions in CmrA found in PJ mutants were shown to constantly activate this regulator. Further characterization by gene inactivation showed that cmrA is responsible for the activation of the expression of the mexEF-oprN operon in PJ mutants. The locus cmrA was characterized and the complete sequence, including regulatory sequeces, was submitted to GenBank (accession number KX274690). Further analysis showed that the CmrA-activating pathway was dependent on mexS and mexT, both genes are known to affect mexEF-oprN expression. Finally, the transcriptomic analysis of the PJ01 mutant (compared to PA14 and to PJ01∆mexT) revealed that CmrA significally activate the expression of 11 genes most of them coding for enzymes involved in redox regulation. Conclusions: The discovery of cmrA opens the posibility to give an explanation to those clinical strains overproducing the efflux pump MexEF-OprN for unknown reasons. Our data shows that this regulator can activate the efflux pump in a way that the strain is capable to tolerate the antibiotics substrates of the pump and to mantain its capacity to produce some virulence traits. CmrA seems to have a role in the activation of regulatory pathways involved in redox homeostasis as shown by the transcriptomic analysis. The fact that the MexEF-OprN pump is activated at the same time that a redox system let us think that this pump could be related to intracellular detoxification of molecules altering the intracellular homeostasis as it has been previously proposed. We are currently analyzing the transcriptome of CmrA to describe the whole activation pathway of this regulator. Overall design: Analysis of 3 samples of total RNA from Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains (PA14, PJ01 and PJ01ΔmexT). Each sample was analyzed in triplicate.

503	338932	PRJEB14440	Other	BackgroundThe primary cause of morbidity and mortality in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients is lung infection by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Therefore much work has been done to understand the adaptation and evolution of P. aeruginosa in the CF lung. However, many of these studies have focused on longitudinally collected single isolates, and only few have included cross-sectional analyses of entire P. aeruginosa populations in sputum samples. To date only few studies have used the approach of metagenomic analysis for the purpose of investigating P. aeruginosa populations in CF airways. ResultsWe analysed five metagenomes together with longitudinally collected single isolates from four recently chronically infected CF patients. With this approach we were able to link the clone type and the majority of SNP profiles of the single isolates to that of the metagenome(s) for each individual patient. ConclusionBased on our analysis we find that when having access to comprehensive collections of longitudinal single isolates it is possible to rediscover the genotypes of the single isolates in the metagenomic samples. This suggests that information gained from genome sequencing of comprehensive collections of single isolates is satisfactory for many investigations of adaptation and evolution of P. aeruginosa to the CF airways.	eSequencing	Pseusomonas aeruginosa metagenomes	eWhole	eGenome	eMonoisolate	Is genotyping of single isolates sufficient for population structure analysis of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in cystic fibrosis airways?						2016-08-15		2016-08-15		Technical University of Denmark

509	327975	PRJEB12111	Other	Infections with Pseudomonas aeruginosa increase morbidity in primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) and cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. Both diseases are associated with a defect of the mucociliary clearance; in PCD caused by non-functional cilia, in CF by changed mucus. Whole genome sequencing of P. aeruginosa isolates from CF patients has shown that persistence of clonal lineages in the airways is facilitated by genetic adaptation. It is unknown whether this also applies to P. aeruginosa airway infections in PCD. We compared within-host evolution of P. aeruginosa in PCD and CF patients. P. aeruginosa isolates from 12 PCD patients were whole genome sequenced and phenotypically characterised. Ten out of 12 PCD patients were infected with persisting clone types. We identified convergent evolution in eight genes, which are also important for persistent infections in CF airways: genes related to antibiotic resistance, quorum sensing, motility, type III secretion and mucoidity. We document phenotypic and genotypic parallelism in the evolution of P. aeruginosa across infected patients with different genetic disorders. The parallel changes and convergent adaptation and evolution may be caused by similar selective forces such as the intensive antibiotic treatment and the inflammatory response, which drive the evolutionary processes.	eSequencing	Longitudinal analysis of PCD airway infection	eWhole	eGenome	eMonoisolate	Bacterial evolution in PCD and CF patients follows the same mutational steps						2016-07-06		2016-07-06		Technical University of Denmark

523	325110	PRJEB14322	Other	The opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa controls the production of virulence factors via its quorum sensing (QS) systems. The addition of 100 μM 4-GB to succinate-containing medium led to a strong reduction of pyocyanin production in strain PAO1∆gbuA, whereas pyocyanin production by the wildtype was not affected. To investigate possible transcriptional differences between the two strains RNAseq analysis of strains PAO1 and PAO1∆gbuA in the presence of 4-GB was performed. RNA was extracted in late exponential phase. For the isolation of RNA for RNAseq analysis, pre-cultures of strains PAO1 and PAO1∆gbuA were grown in medium B containing 20 mM succinate for 12 h at 37°C. Cells were washed and used to inoculate main cultures in medium B containing 20 mM succinate and 100 μM 4-GB in triplicates with an OD600 of 0.001. After incubation for 11 h at 37°C, the respective triplicates were combined, harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in medium B without complementing solutions. From these cell suspensions, RNA was extracted with the innuPREP RNA Minikit from Analytik Jena (Jena, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Residual DNA was removed by digestion with 10 U RNase-free DNase I (Thermo scientific) for 1 h in the presence of RiboLock RNase inhibitor (Thermo scientific). After DNA digestion, the RNA was again purified with the same kit. RNA quality was checked by Trinean Xpose (Gentbrugge, Belgium) and the Agilent RNA Nano 6000 Kit on an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Boblingen, Germany).

528	322024	PRJNA322024	Other	Transcriptional regulatory networks represent an important organizational element in the bacterial cell where signals from the cell state and the outside environment are integrated in terms of activation and inhibition of gene transcription. How these networks evolve is not well understood, and the effects of natural occurring polymorphisms within network components are often not known. Here, we systematically investigate the functional consequences of an amino acid substitution in the sigma factor protein RpoN in the opportunitic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. While RpoN is known to be important for virulence gene expression in P. aeruginosa, the particular amino acid substitution is important for ecological success of the bacteria in cystic fibrosis infections. We use Chromatin Immunoprecipitation coupled to deep sequencing (ChIP-seq), transcriptional profiling as well as in vitro protein-DNA interaction studies and show that the rpoN mutation results in reduced connections to only parts of the RpoN controlled regulatory network. On the other hand, the mutation results in activation of other sigma factor regulons. Finally, our results also show that the rpoN mutation results in a rewiring of the RpoN network in terms of increased connectivity and positive regulatory effect on a virulence associated locus. This molecular pleiotropy could not have been predicted from in silico analyses alone, and this work thus underlines the importance of achieving a molecular understanding of the effects of polymorphisms in regulator network components Overall design: ChIP-seq experiments, transcriptome profiling and in vitro DNA interaction abbility of the sigma factor RpoN and its single amino acid substitution mutant, RpoN(DK2)	eSequencing	Pseudomonas aeruginosa	eWhole	eOther	eMultiisolate	Rewiring of a sigma factor regulatory network in P. aeruginosa by a naturally occurring single nucleotide polymorphism			287	287	eBacteria	2016-05-18		2019-05-01		Prof. Dieter Jahn, Institute of Microbiology, Technische Universität Braunschweig

549	317079	PRJEB6010	Other	In non-laboratory settings bacteria typically reside in matrix-encased biofilm communities. The polymeric biofilm matrix, like other cooperative secretions produced by bacteria, has the potential to be exploited by non-producing bacteria that avoid the energy cost associated with matrix production (i.e. cheaters). Theory, however, predicts that matrix production should be stable against cheating under substrate limitation. Here we show empirically that matrix production by Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA14, a major biofilm-forming pathogen, is favorable under conditions of electron acceptor limitation but not when electron acceptor is abundant. We show that distinct locations within the same biofilm can either select for or against matrix production depending on the local availability of electron acceptor. Our results are consistent with theoretical models, which predict that matrix production allows cell lineages to position themselves favorably within electron acceptor gradients. However, spatial differences in electron acceptor availability within the same biofilm can lead to clonal heterogeneity. By integrating concepts from biofilm engineering and evolutionary biology we suggest a model for the emergence of polyclonality in P. aeruginosa biofilms, a finding relevant for our understanding of persistent infections.	eSequencing	Clonal Diversification PA14	eOther	eOther	eMonoisolate	Spatial Heterogeneity in Electron Acceptor Availability Stimulates Clonal Diversification in Biofilms						2016-04-01		2016-04-01		UNIVERSITY OF COPENHAGEN

552	316121	PRJNA316121	transcriptome	Depletion of ribosomal (r)RNA is essential in the preparation of bacterial RNA-seq libraries. While a number of bacterial rRNA depletion procedures, demonstrating variable efficiency, have become available, comparative evaluation of these methods has remained limited. This project was aimed at evaluating the efficiency of three kits (Illumina Ribo-Zero rRNA Removal Kit [Bacteria], Ambion MICROBExpress™ Bacterial mRNA Enrichment Kit, and Life Technologies RiboMinus Transcriptome Isolation Kit, Bacteria) in depleting rRNA from samples derived from the opportunistic human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa grown as biofilms. This is the first such evaluation performed for P. aeruginosa or for bacterial biofilm samples, a comparison made more important by the findings of biofilms have higher rRNA:mRNA ratios and higher rRNA carryover during RNA-seq analysis.	eSequencing	Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1	eWhole	eTranscriptome	eMultiisolate	Pseudomonas aeruginosa rRNA depletion RNA-seq analysis		PAO1	208964	287	eBacteria	2016-03-23		2016-03-23		Binghamton University

560	310847	PRJEB12001	Other	Prokaryotic CRISPR-Cas adaptive immune systems insert spacers derived from viruses and other parasitic DNA elements into CRISPR loci to provide sequence-specific immunity. This frequently results in high within-population spacer diversity, but it is unclear if and why this is important. Here, we show that as a result of this spacer diversity, viruses can no longer evolve to overcome CRISPR-Cas by point mutation, which results in rapid virus extinction. This effect arises from synergy between spacer diversity and the high specificity of infection, which greatly increases overall population resistance. We propose that the resulting short-lived nature of CRISPR-dependent bacteria-virus coevolution has provided strong selection for the evolution of more sophisticated virus-encoded anti-CRISPR mechanisms.	eSequencing	CRISPR diversity in Pseudomonas aeruginosa	eOther	eOther	eMonoisolate	The diversity-generating benefits of a prokaryotic adaptive immune system						2016-02-04	2016-02-03T00:00:00Z	2016-02-04		LIV			27074511	ePubmed

582	304966	PRJEB11978	Other	Antibiotic resistance carries a fitness cost that must be overcome in order for resistance to persist over the long term. Compensatory mutations that recover the functional defects associated with resistance mutations have been argued to play a key role in overcoming the cost of resistance, but compensatory mutations are expected to be rare relative to generally beneficial mutations that increase fitness irrespective of antibiotic resistance. Given this asymmetry, population genetics theory predicts that populations should adapt by compensatory mutations when the cost of resistance is large, while generally beneficial mutations should drive adaptation when the cost of resistance is small. We tested this prediction by determining the genomic mechanisms underpinning adaptation to antibiotic-free conditions in populations of the pathogenic bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa that carry costly antibiotic resistance mutations. Whole-genome sequencing revealed that populations founded by high-cost rifampicin-resistant mutants adapted via compensatory mutations in three genes of the RNA polymerase core enzyme, whereas populations founded by low-cost mutants adapted by generally beneficial mutations, predominantly in the quorum sensing transcriptional regulator gene lasR. Even though the importance of compensatory evolution in maintaining resistance has been widely recognised, our study shows that the roles of general adaptation in maintaining resistance should not be underestimated and highlights the need to understand how selection at other sites in the genome influences the dynamics of resistance alleles in clinical settings.	eSequencing	The genomic basis of adaptation to the fitness cost of rifampicin resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa	eOther	eOther	eMonoisolate	The genomic basis of adaptation to the fitness cost of rifampicin resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa						2015-12-03	2015-12-02T00:00:00Z	2015-12-03		UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD

587	303970	PRJNA303970	Transcriptome or Gene expression	Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections for individuals with Cystic Fibrosis (CF), result in high morbidity and mortality, with premature death often occurring. These infections are complicated by the formation of biofilms in the sputum. Antibiotic therapy is stymied by antibiotic resistance of the biofilm matrix, making novel anti-biofilm strategies highly desirable. Within the P. aeruginosa biofilm, the redox factor pyocyanin enhances biofilm integrity by intercalating with extracellular DNA. The antioxidant glutathione (GSH) reacts with pyocyanin to disrupt intercalation. This study investigated GSH disruption by assaying the physiological effects of GSH and DNase I on biofilms of clinical CF isolates grown in artificial CF sputum media (ASMDM+). Confocal scanning laser microscopy showed that 2mM GSH alone or combined with DNase I significantly disrupted the immature (24 hour) biofilms of Australian Epidemic Strain (AES) isogens AES-1R and AES-1M. GSH alone greatly disrupted the mature (72 hour) biofilm of AES-1R, resulting in significant differential expression of 587 genes, as evidenced by RNA-sequencing. Upregulated systems included cyclic diguanylate and pyoverdine biosynthesis, the Type VI secretion system, nitrate metabolism and translational machinery. Physiochemical biofilm disruption with GSH revealed a metabolically active cellular physiology distinct from either mature or dispersed biofilm physiology. RNA-seq results were validated by biochemical assay and qPCR. Biofilms of a range of CF isolates disrupted with GSH and DNase I were significantly more susceptible to ciprofloxacin, and increased antibiotic effectiveness was achieved at 10mM GSH. This study demonstrated that GSH alone or with DNase I represent effective anti-biofilm treatments when combined with appropriate antibiotics. Overall design: Examination of the effects of 2mM glutathione (GSH) on the mature (72 hour) biofilms of P. aeruginosa strain AES-1R. 2 replicates control (1× PBS treated) 2 replicates 2mM GSH treated.

593	299722	PRJEB9801	Other	Temperate phages are an important driver of genomic diversification in bacterial pathogens1. Phage-derived sequences are more common in pathogenic than non-pathogenic taxa2, while the majority of genetic divergence between certain virulent and avirulent strains is attributable to prophage elements3. Host-associated microbial communities exhibit high abundances4 and rates of mobilisation of temperate phages5, highlighting the potential for these mobile elements to facilitate rapid within-host evolution of bacterial pathogens. However, the role of temperate phages in pathogen evolution has not been experimentally tested. We experimentally evolved replicate populations of Pseudomonas aeruginosa with or without a community of 3 temperate phages isolated from cystic fibrosis (CF) lung infections (LESɸ2, ɸ3 and ɸ4)6. Populations grew as free-floating biofilms in artificial sputum medium (ASM)7, mimicking sputum of CF lungs where P. aeruginosa is the most common and clinically important pathogen and undergoes extensive evolutionary adaptation8 and diversification9,10 during chronic infection. Bacterial populations both with and without phages adapted to the biofilm environment, however, population genomic analysis revealed that phages altered both the trajectory and mode of evolution. We observed more highly parallel evolution in populations with phages than populations without phages, targeting motility-associated genes and regulators of quorum sensing systems controlling cell-cell communication and virulence. Moreover, prophage integration increased the supply of parallel positively selected mutations. Temperate phages are therefore likely to facilitate within host adaptive evolution of bacterial pathogens.	eSequencing	Temperate phages and evolution in pathogen biofilms	eOther	eOther	eMonoisolate	An investigation of how temperate bacteriophage affect the mode of evolution in biofilms of pathogens such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa						2015-10-24	2015-10-23T00:00:00Z	2015-10-24		UNIVERSITY OF LIVERPOOL

601	296610	PRJNA296610	Transcriptome or Gene expression	Purpose: Free nitrous acid (FNA) has recently been demonstrated as an antimicrobial agent to a range of microorganisms. However, its antimicrobial mechanism is largely unknown. For this study Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 was selected to gain a systematic understanding of the antimicrobial mechanism of FNA. Methods: PAO1 was grown under anaerobic denitrifying conditions and when FNA was added (0.1 mg-N/L) growth temporarily stopped. From cultures with and without added FNA, RNA was extracted and the abundance of gene transcripts was detected by sequencing. Transcripts exhibiting ≥2.5 or ≤-2.5 fold abundance change in the presence of FNA were designated as differentially expressed. Results:In response to FNA, 167 genes showed increased transcription while 424 exhibited deceased transcript levels. Respiration was likely inhibited as denitrification activity was severely decreased. Genes coding for enzymes of the tricarboxylic acid cycle were down regulated, while highly increased transcripts were detected for pyruvate fermentation, indicating a possible survival response to FNA. Moreover, genes coding ribosomal proteins had significantly decreased transcript levels, implicating that protein biosynthesis was severely inhibited by FNA. Whereas, genes encoding proteins functioning to preserve ribosome units under stressful conditions, were up-regulated during FNA exposure. Conclusion: In this study, we performed genome-wide high throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) analysis on PAO1 in the absence and presence of a bacteriostatic-level of FNA (0.1 mg N/L). By combining the global activated/suppressed gene profiles and detected physiological responses, we detected the microbial response to FNA exposure and revealed potential antimicrobial mechanisms of FNA on this prevalent opportunistic pathogen and environmentally relevant denitrifier. Overall design: mRNA profiles of P. aeruginosa PAO1 towards FNA stress were generated by next generation sequencing in triplicate via Illumina 2000.	eSequencing	Pseudomonas aeruginosa	eWhole	eTranscriptome	eMultiisolate	Next generation sequencing of Pseudomonas aruginosa PAO1 in the presence of Free Nitrous Acid stress			287	287	eBacteria	2015-09-22		2016-07-08		Gehrmann Laboratories (60#), Advanced Water Management Centre, The University of Queensland	ePublished	2016-04-27T00:00:00Z	27116299	ePubmed

Whole transcriptome sequencing by RNA-seq is a relatively new method for gene expression analysis. We utilized both tools for expression analysis of Pseudomonas aeruginosa growing slowly in synthetic cystic fibrosis medium under growth-limiting nitrate and oxygen levels. We established steady-state cultures under two divergent growth rates and found that during slower growth at a doubling time of 9.8 h, 76 known quorum genes were up-expressed while just 11 were down-expressed. Quorum-controlled genes were also more expressed in response to oxygen limitation. 21% of up-expressed genes under slow, oxygen-limited growth are quorum controlled while just 6% are up-expressed under slow, nitrate-limited growth. We found that the autoinducer for regulator RhlR, C4-HSL, is ~3.4 times higher when cells are growing slowly under oxygen limitation while the concentration of the autoinducer for LasR remained unchanged. Experiments with deletion mutants show the importance of rhlR for expression of quorum-controlled genes under slow, oxygen-limited conditions. This is an intriguing observation since P. aeruginosa is likely growing in similar environments in the cystic fibrosis lung, and lasR mutations are known to arise during chronic infection.

634	291139	PRJNA291139	raw sequence reads	Animals use signals to coordinate a wide range of behaviours, from feeding offspring to predator avoidance. This poses an evolutionary problem, because individuals could potentially signal dishonestly to coerce others into behaving in a way that benefits the signaller. Theory suggests that honest signalling is favoured when individuals share a common interest and signals carry reliable information. However, whilst many studies have manipulated signals, to examine how this influences behaviour, it has not been possible to directly test how the behaviour of signallers and receivers evolve in response to manipulation. Here, we exploit the opportunities offered by signalling between bacteria (quorum sensing). Using experimental evolution, phenotypic and genomic approaches, we show that: (1) a reduced relatedness, and therefore reduced common interest between interacting individuals, leads to the relative breakdown of signalling, via both reduced signalling and a reduced response to signal; (2) signal interference selects for lower levels of signalling. More generally, whilst our results provide clear support for signalling theory, we did not find evidence for the previously predicted coercion at intermediate relatedness, suggesting that mechanistic details can alter even the qualitative nature of specific predictions. Furthermore, populations evolved under low relatedness caused less mortality and damage to insect hosts, showing how signal evolution in bacterial pathogens can drive the evolution of virulence in the opposite direction to that usually predicted by theory.	eSequencing	Pseudomonas aeruginosa	eWhole	eGenome	eMultiisolate	Pseudomonas aeruginosa Raw sequence reads;NERC;HFSP;UM;WT			287	287	eBacteria	2015-07-28		2015-07-28		University of Nottingham	eUnpublished	2015-08-18T00:00:00Z	26282874	ePubmed

636	289989	PRJDB4025	Genome sequencing	The emergence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates, which are resistant to all beta-lactams, aminoglycosides, and fluoroquinolones, is a serious medical problem worldwide. In this study, 40 multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates were obtained in a medical setting to perform an epidemiological study in Vietnam. Of them, 25 isolates harbored metallo-beta-lactamase encoding genes, including blaIMP-7, blaIMP-26, blaIMP-51 and blaNDM-1. The blaIMP-51 was a novel IMP variant and IMP-51 had an amino acid substitution (Ser262Gly) compared with IMP-7. E. coli expressing blaIMP-51 was significantly resistant to cefotaxime, meropenem and moxalactam, compared with E. coli expressing blaIMP-7. The amino acid residue at the position 262 was located near the active site, proximal to the H263 Zn(II) ligand. Phylogenic analysis constructed from the SNP concatemers revealed that 15, 4 and 4 isolates belonged ST235, ST310 and ST773, respectively.	eSequencing	Pseudomonas aeruginosa	eWhole	eGenome	eMultiisolate	Epidemiological study on multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa clinical isolates in Vietnam			287	287	eBacteria	2015-06-26	2015-07-14T09:47:50Z	2015-07-15	yes	Department of Infectious Diseases, National Center for Global Health and Medicine

Patients with thermal (burn) injuries are very susceptible to P. aeruginosa infections. These infections often spread from the wound site and become systemic. P. aeruginosa virulence has been extensively studied, however, most studies utilize synthetic growth media which is tailored to optimize the expression of certain virulence factors. In this study, we compared the gene expression of P. aeruginosa PA14 grown in blood from several healthy volunteers versus blood obtained from patients with severe thermal (burn) injuries.

647	287242	PRJEB9312	Genome sequencing and assembly	Whole genome sequencing (WGS) was carried out on 87 isolates of ST-111 of Pseudomonas aeruginosa collected between 2005 and 2014 from 65 patients and 12 environmental isolates from 24 hospital laboratories across the United Kingdom on an Illumina HiSeq. Most isolates (73) carried VIM-2, but others carried IMP (IMP-1 or IMP-13) (5) or NDM-1 (1); one isolate had VIM-2 and IMP-18 and 7 carried no metallo-beta-lactamase (MBL) gene. Single nucleotide polymorphism analysis divided the isolates into distinct clusters, with the NDM-1 isolate an outlier and the IMP isolates and 6 MBL-negative isolates clustering separately from the main set of 72 VIM-2 isolates. Within the VIM-2 set, there were at least 3 distinct clusters, including a tightly clustered set of isolates from 3 hospital laboratories consistent with an outbreak from a single introduction that was quickly brought under control and a much broader set dominated by isolates from a long-running outbreak in a London hospital, also including isolates from 7 other hospital laboratories in London and South East England, likely seeded from an environmental source, requiring different control measures. Bayesian Evolutionary Analysis indicated all the isolates shared a common ancestor dating back some 50 years (1960s), with the main VIM-2 set separating approximately 20 to 30 years ago. Accessory gene profiling revealed blocks of genes associated with particular clusters, with some having high similarity (≥95 %) to bacteriophage genes. WGS of international lineages such as ST-111 that are widely found provides the necessary resolution to inform epidemiological investigations and intervention policies.	eSequencing	Pseudomonas study	eWhole	eOther	eMonoisolate	High-resolution analysis by whole genome sequencing of an international lineage (ST-111) of Pseudomonas aeruginosa associated with metallo-carbapenemases in the United Kingdom						2015-06-17	2015-06-15T00:00:00Z	2015-06-17		PHE

651	287040	PRJNA287040	Epigenomics	DNA methylation is an important regulator of genome function in the eukaryotes, but it is currently unclear if the same is true in prokaryotes. While regulatory functions have been demonstrated for a small number of bacteria, there have been no large-scale studies of prokaryotic methylomes and the full repertoire of targets and biological functions of DNA methylation remains unclear. Here we applied single-molecule, real-time sequencing to directly study the methylomes of 232 phylogenetically diverse prokaryotes. Collectively, we identified 834 methylated motifs, enabling the specific annotation of 415 DNA methyltransferases (MTases), and adding substantially to existing databases of MTase specificities. While the majority of MTases function as components of restriction-modification systems, 139 MTases have no cognate restriction enzyme in the genome, suggesting some other functional role. Several of these ‘orphan’ MTases are conserved across species and exhibit patterns of DNA methylation consistent with known regulatory MTases. Based on these patterns of methylation, we identify candidate novel regulators of gene expression in several phyla of bacteria, and candidate regulators of DNA replication in Haloarchaea. Together these data substantially advance our knowledge of DNA restriction-modification systems, and hint at a wider role for methylation in prokaryotic genome regulation. Overall design: Single-molecule, real-time sequencing of DNA modifications across 232 diverse prokaryotic genomes.	eSequencing	The Epigenomic Landscape of Prokaryotes	eWhole	eGenome	eMultispecies	The Epigenomic Landscape of Prokaryotes						2015-06-15		2016-04-01		Rubin / Pennacchio, Genomics Division, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory	ePublished	2016-02-13T00:00:00Z	26870957	ePubmed

Initially pathogenic bacteria evolved novel commensalistic symbioses with all host types through functionally convergent mutations involving the global regulator of virulence and quorum sensing lasR and the polymerase gene rpoB. These mutations turned the pathogens into highly fit, avirulent commensalists that achieve high prevalence in host organisms while also supported supporting higher host fitness.

673	281531	PRJNA281531	genome sequencing and assembly	Commingling and transportation of cattle is common within the North American beef production system as is the use of macrolide antibiotics to treat or control bovine respiratory disease complex (BRDC). Therefore, the purpose of this project was to evaluate the effects of commingling, transportation, and antibiotic treatment for the control of bovine respiratory disease complex on the diversity and dynamics of nasopharyngeal and rectoanal mucosal bacterial populations in beef calves. <p> Three groups of 60 commercial 5-7-month-old male beef calves were used in this study, each originating either from Missouri, Kentucky or Tennessee and were transported to a backgrounding facility in Kansas in late September 2013. On arrival at the facility, calves from within each source were randomly assigned to receive either a macrolide antibiotic or saline injection and assigned to separate pens according to treatment within source for a total of 6 pens; for the duration of the trial, each pen was prevented from nose-to-nose contact with any other pen. Nasopharyngeal samples from these calves were collected at four time points: at the sale barn before transport (day 0), at the backgrounding facility upon arrival (day 1), and 9 and 28 days later. Additionally, calves were monitored daily for signs of BRDC using a clinical illness scoring (CIS) system and rectal temperature cutoff as described in (DeDonder et al., 2015). If a calf met the case definition for BRDC, they were treated with a macrolide antibiotic, and additional nasopharyngeal samples were obtained at the time of classification of onset of BRDC morbidity. <p> These samples were processed using classical microbiological techniques for bacterial isolation, and some isolates were selected for species identification, antimicrobial resistance testing, and whole genome sequencing. The selection criteria for the nasopharyngeal isolates were either that the bacterial species was not represented by a closed genome in GenBank or that the species was known to be associated with respiratory disease in other mammals.	eSequencing		eWhole	eGenome	eMultispecies	Genome sequencing, assembly and antibiograms of bacteria isolated from calves in an epidemiological study of bovine respiratory disease complex						2015-04-18		2015-04-18		USDA-ARS-USMARC	eUnpublished	2015-10-06T00:00:00Z	26441021	ePubmed

688	273742	PRJNA273742	Transcriptome or Gene expression	N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is one of the most abundant modifications in eukaryotic RNA. Recent mapping of m6A methylomes in mammals, yeast, and plants as well as characterization of m6A methyltransferases, demethylases, and binding proteins have revealed regulatory functions of this dynamic RNA modification. In bacteria, although m6A is present in ribosomal RNA (rRNA), its occurrence in messenger RNA (mRNA) still remains elusive. Here, we used liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) to calculate the m6A/A ratio in mRNA from a wide range of bacterial species, which demonstrates that m6A is an abundant mRNA modification in tested bacteria. Subsequent transcriptome-wide m6A profiling in Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa revealed a conserved distinct m6A pattern that is significantly different from that in eukaryotes. Most m6A peaks are located inside open reading frames (ORF), and carry a unique consensus motif (GCCAU). Functional enrichment analysis of bacterial m6A peaks indicates that the majority of m6A-modified transcripts are associated with respiration, amino acids metabolism, stress response, and small RNAs genes, suggesting potential regulatory roles of m6A in these pathways.

690	272849	PRJEB8227	Other	Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) plays a central role in the evolution of microbes. Despite the benefits associated with HGT, newly acquired genetic material can also generate fitness costs that are likely to impose an important constraint on evolution by HGT. In this study, we use the interaction between Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 and a costly small plasmid (pNUK73) as a model system to investigate the molecular basis of the cost of HGT. Using RNA-Seq, we show that the acquisition of pNUK73 results in a profound alteration of the transcriptional profile of the PAO1 chromosome, including the activation of the SOS response. Compensatory mutations in either a chromosomal helicase or kinase eliminate the fitness cost of plasmid carriage and reverse the changes in chromosomal gene expression associated with pNUK73 acquisition. Compensatory mutations also decrease the expression of the plasmid replication gene rep, and we experimentally demonstrate that high levels of rep expression drive the cost associated with pNUK73 carriage and the activation of the SOS response. Both genes involved in compensatory adaptation show multiple signatures of recent horizontal acquisition in the PAO1 genome and present no clear biological role in PAO1, implying that the cost of pNUK73 stems from intragenomic conflict between recently horizontally acquired genes. Our study provides new insights into the evolutionary and molecular mechanisms responsible for the cost of HGT, and we argue that interactions between mobile genetic elements may play an important role in the evolution of bacteria via HGT.	eSequencing		eOther	eOther	eMonoisolate	Interactions between horizontally acquired genes create a fitness cost in Pseudomonas aeruginosa						2015-01-17	2015-01-16T00:00:00Z	2015-01-17		UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD

693	269980	PRJNA269980	Other	Two-component systems (TCS) serve as basic stimulus-response coupling mechanisms to allow organisms to sense and respond to a large variety of environmental conditions. In the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa, more than 100 genes encode TCS components. To avoid unwanted cross-talk between TCSs, the signaling cascades are usually very specific, with one sensor talking to its cognate response regulator. However, cross-regulation may provide effective means to integrate different environmental stimuli into a harmonized output response and thus to coordinate gene expression in response to complex and challenging habitats. Here, we applied a protein-fragment complementation assay (PCA) and identified a direct interaction of two response regulators of the OmpR/PhoB subfamily, namely PhoB and TctD in P. aeruginosa in vivo. Transcriptional profiling and ChIP-seq analysis uncovered adjacent bipartite binding motifs of the two response regulators in 8 promoter regions, of which 6 showed a common PhoB-TctD binding motif with a fixed spacing between the two motifs. We further demonstrate that phosphate limitation exhibits a PhoB-dependent activating activity on the expression of those genes, whereas the presence of a preferred carbon source inhibits gene expression in a TctD-dependent manner. Thus, the perception and the integration of two important environmental signals are achieved by a titration of the relative amounts of two phosphorylated response regulators that inversely regulate a common subset of genes. In conclusion, our results shed light on the general principles underlying two-component signal transduction pathways and the exploitation of cross-regulation to adapt bacterial behavior to complex environments.

715	259850	PRJEB5488	Other	Bacterial infections causing mastitis in sheep can result in severe economic losses for farmers. A large survey of milk samples from ewes with mastitis in Sardinia, Italy, indicated an increasing prevalence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections. Using quantitative PCR to determine the expression of P. aeruginosa genes directly in mastitis-associated ovine milk samples, we found that gene expression profiles resembled those obtained for strain PAO1 grown as a biofilm, rather than grown to exponential or stationary phase. Furthermore, we report the phenotypic and genomic characterisation of two clonal P. aeruginosa isolates (PSE305 and PSE306) from a mastitis infection outbreak, representing distinct colony morphology variants. In addition to pigment production, PSE305 and PSE306 differed in phenotypic characteristics including biofilm formation, utilisation of various carbon and nitrogen sources, twitching motility. We found higher levels of expression of genes associated with biofilm formation (pelB) and twitching motility (flgD) in PSE305, compared to the biofilm and twitching-defective PSE306. Comparative genomics analysis revealed single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and minor insertion / deletion variations between PSE305 and PSE306, including a SNP mutation in the pilP gene of PSE306. By introducing a wild-type pilP gene we were able to partially complement the defective twitching motility of PSE306. There were also three larger regions of difference between the two genomes, indicating genomic instability. Hence, we have demonstrated that P. aeruginosa population divergence can occur during an outbreak of mastitis, leading to significant variations in phenotype and genotype, and resembling the behaviour of P. aeruginosa during some chronic respiratory infections.	eSequencing	Pseudomonas aeruginosa ovine mastitis samples	eOther	eOther	eMonoisolate	Divergence of a strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa during an outbreak of ovine mastitis in Sardinia						2014-08-29	2014-08-28T00:00:00Z	2014-08-29		IGH	ePublished		25475851	ePubmed
716	259282	PRJEB7066	Other	Plasmids are catalysts of bacterial evolution that permit adaptation to novel selective pressures, such as antibiotics. However, it remains challenging to understand how plasmids can persist over the long term as a result of fitness costs associated with plasmid carriage. Classical models predict that horizontal transfer is necessary for plasmids to persist, but whole genome sequencing has recently revealed that almost half of plasmids are non-transmissible. Here we use a combination of mathematical modelling and experimental evolution coupled to whole genome sequencing to investigate how a simple, non-transmissible plasmid, pNUK73, can be maintained in populations of the pathogenic bacterium P. aeruginosa. We find that positive selection for plasmid-encoded antibiotic resistance and compensatory adaptation allow pNUK73 to become rapidly stabilized. Compensatory adaptation by P. aeruginosa recovers the cost associated with plasmid carriage, but compensation alone is not sufficient to maintain the plasmid as a result of segregational loss of plasmids. Positive selection mediated by exposure to antibiotics is necessary to increase plasmid frequency and offset the effects of segregational loss. Crucially, we find that feedback occurs between these processes. Positive selection increases the efficacy of selection for compensatory adaptation by increasing the population size of plasmid-bearing lineages. Compensatory adaptation, in turn, increases the effect of positive selection on plasmid stability by slowing the rate at which the plasmid is lost between episodes of positive selection. Our study provides a new understanding of how plasmids can persist in bacterial populations, and it helps to explain why plasmid-mediated resistance can be maintained in bacterial populations after antibiotic use is stopped.	eSequencing		eOther	eOther	eMonoisolate	Positive selection and compensatory adaptation interact to stabilize non-transmissible plasmids						2014-08-23	2014-08-22T00:00:00Z	2014-08-23		UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD

Zinc limitation was assessed in the P. aeruginosa PAO1 strain using an isogenic deletion mutant lacking the periplasmic, zinc solute-binding protein, znuA (PA5498). ZnuA delivers bound zinc to its cognate ABC transporter, ZnuBC, for import into the cytoplasm. Our transcriptional analyses revealed P. aeruginosa to possess a multitude of zinc acquisition mechanisms, each of which were highly up-regulated in the zinc-deficient znuA mutant strain. P. aeruginosa also utilized zinc-independent paralogues of zinc-dependent genes to maintain cellular function under zinc limitation. Together, these data reveal the complex transcriptional response and versatility of P. aeruginosa to zinc depletion.

729	252740	PRJNA252740	Transcriptome or Gene expression	Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteriophage PhiKZ is the type representative of the ‘giant’ phage genus with unusually large virions and genomes. By unraveling the transcriptional map of the 280 kb genome to single-nucleotide resolution, we show that it encodes 369 genes organized in 134 operons, 20% more than originally annotated. Early transcription is initiated from 28 highly conserved AT-rich promoters distributed over the PhiKZ genome, all located on the same strand. Transcription of middle and late genes is dependent on protein synthesis and mediated by very poorly conserved middle (6) and late (16) promoters. As a result of massive PhiKZ transcription, halfway through infection only 1.5% of all mRNAs in the infected cell remain bacterial. Unique to PhiKZ is its ability to complete its infection in complete absence of bacterial RNA polymerase (RNAP) enzyme activity. Its transcription is performed by the consecutive action of two PhiKZ-encoded, non-canonical RNAPs, one of which is packed within the virion. This unique, rifampicin-resistant transcriptional machinery is conserved among giant viruses, seems to function without auxiliary factors and might have its origin preceding the split between Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Overall design: Construction of transcription maps for the PhiKZ phage and analysis of differential expression of host and phage genes using RNA-Seq data from samples taken in duplicate at 0, 5, 10, 15, and 35 minutes into infection.	eSequencing	RNA-Seq analysis of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 cells infected with PhiKZ phage	eWhole	eTranscriptome	eMultispecies	RNA-Seq analysis of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 cells infected with PhiKZ phage						2014-06-13		2018-10-18		Laboratory of Gene Technology, Afdeling Gentechnologie, KU Leuven	ePublished	2014-06-27T00:00:00Z	24965474	ePubmed

731	252560	PRJNA252560	Transcriptome or Gene expression	We compared the dynamics and mechanisms of resistance development to ceftazidime, meropenem, ciprofloxacin, and ceftolozane-tazobactam in wild-type (PAO1) and mutator (PAOMS, ∆mutS) P. aeruginosa. The strains were incubated for 24 h with 0.5 to 64× MICs of each antibiotic in triplicate experiments. The tubes from the highest antibiotic concentration showing growth were reinoculated in fresh medium containing concentrations up to 64× MIC for 7 consecutive days. The susceptibility profiles and resistance mechanisms were assessed in two isolated colonies from each step, antibiotic, and strain. Ceftolozane-tazobactam-resistant mutants were further characterized by whole-genome analysis through RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). The development of high-level resistance was fastest for ceftazidime, followed by meropenem and ciprofloxacin. None of the mutants selected with these antibiotics showed cross-resistance to ceftolozane-tazobactam. On the other hand, ceftolozane-tazobactam resistance development was much slower, and high-level resistance was observed for the mutator strain only. PAO1 derivatives that were moderately resistant (MICs, 4 to 8 ug/ml) to ceftolozane-tazobactam showed only 2 to 4 mutations, which determined global pleiotropic effects associated with a severe fitness cost. High-level-resistant (MICs, 32 to 128 ug/ml) PAOMS derivatives showed 45 to 53 mutations. Major changes in the global gene expression profiles were detected in all mutants, but only PAOMS mutants showed ampC overexpression, which was caused by dacB or ampR mutations. Moreover, all PAOMS mutants contained 1 to 4 mutations in the conserved residues of AmpC (F147L, Q157R, G183D, E247K, or V356I). Complementation studies revealed that these mutations greatly increased ceftolozane-tazobactam and ceftazidime MICs but reduced those of piperacillin-tazobactam and imipenem, compared to those in wild-type ampC. Therefore, the development of high-level resistance to ceftolozane-tazobactam appears to occur efficiently only in a P. aeruginosa mutator background, in which multiple mutations lead to overexpression and structural modifications of AmpC.

We used our recently established in-vivo murine tumor model to investigate mutual influences of the two pathogens during a biofilm-associated infection process. We found that although P. aeruginosa and V. parvula colonized distinct niches within the tumor, in mice that were co-infected with both bacterial species significant higher cell numbers of P. aeruginosa were recovered from the tumor tissue. Concordantly, in vivo transcriptional profiling implied that the presence of V. parvula supports P. aeruginosa growth at the infected host site, and the higher P. aeruginosa load correlated with clinical deterioration.

735	248092	PRJEB6331	Other	Chronic bacterial infections are a key feature of a variety of lung conditions. The opportunistic bacterium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, is extremely skilled at both colonising and persisting in the airways of patients with lung damage. It has been suggested that the upper airways (including the paranasal sinuses and nasopharynx) play an important role as a silent reservoir of bacteria. Over time, P. aeruginosa can adapt to its niche, leading to increased resistance in the face of the immune system and intense therapy regimes. Here we describe a unique murine respiratory inhalation model of P. aeruginosa infection that establishes for at least 28 days. We present evidence for adaptation in vivo, in terms of phenotype and genotype, suggesting that there is persistence in the airways and that the upper respiratory tract is a key niche in establishment of infection. This novel model provides a unique platform for studying evolutionary dynamics and therapeutics.	eSequencing	Microevolution of P. aeruginosa during murine infection	eOther	eOther	eMonoisolate	Novel murine respiratory inhalation model for long term persistence, adaptation and migration of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.						2014-05-19	2014-05-16T00:00:00Z	2014-05-19		UB

737	247750	PRJEB5303	Other	The airways of most cystic fibrosis patients get colonised with Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteria in childhood or adolescence. In many cases the bacteria are able to establish a chronic infection whose course is a major determinant of the patient’s clinical status and quality of life. The infecting P. aeruginosa strains can display highly divergent phenotypes, which go along with high genomic variability, as 10 – 20 % of the genomic DNA is specific for clonal lineages or even single isolates. Furthermore, the strains acquire mutations during chronic infection which are hypothesized to cause additional phenotypical changes involved in facilitating persistence and adaptation to the CF lung habitat. To analyse the genetic background of strains having established a chronic infection and the following microevolution in the CF lung we performed genome sequencing for sequential isolates from 12 patients’ airways. For all patients, chronic infection was indicated by the presence of an individual clonal lineage over years. Isolates from six patients with a mild and six with a severe clinical course were studied reflecting infection periods of six to nearly 25 years. The genome of the first isolate of a persisting clone was analysed for its clone specific variations and accessory genome compared to the P. aeruginosa reference strain PA14. Then the genomic variations appearing by the later isolates were determined to analyse the microevolution that appeared during the chronic infection and to define hotspots of mutations that are typical for the process of adaptation to the CF lung.	eSequencing	P. aeruginosa sequential isolates from CF patients	eOther	eOther	eMonoisolate	Pseudomonas aeruginosa microevolution during chronic infection of the CF lung							2014-05-14T00:00:00Z			MHH

739	246187	PRJNA246187	Epigenomics	The Pseudomonas aeruginosa quorum-sensing (QS) systems contribute to bacterial homeostasis and pathogenicity. Although the AraC family transcription factor VqsM has been characterized to control the production of virulence factors and QS signaling molecules, its detailed regulatory mechanisms still remain elusive. Here, we report that VqsM directly binds to the lasI promoter region, and thus regulates its expression. To identify additional targets of VqsM in P. aeruginosa PAO1, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput DNA sequencing (ChIP-seq) which detected 48 enriched loci harboring VqsM-binding peaks in P. aeruginosa genome. The direct regulation of these genes by VqsM has been confirmed by Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reactions (qRT-PCR). A VqsM-binding motif is found by using MEME suite and verified by footprint assays in vitro. In addition, VqsM directly binds to the promoter regions of antibiotic resistance regulator NfxB and the master type III system regulator ExsA. Notably, the vqsM mutant displayed more resistance to two types of antibiotics and promoted bacterial survival in a mouse model, compared to the wild type PAO1 strain. Collectively, this work provides new cues to better understand the detailed regulatory networks of QS systems, T3SS, and antibiotic resistance.

742	244840	PRJEB4961	Other	Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteria can display highly divergent phenotypes. This is reflected by a high genomic variability, as typically 10 – 20 % of the genome is made up by DNA specific for clonal lineages or even single isolates. Therefore, a large and diverse pangenome is assumed for this species. In order to characterize composition and size of the pangenome, we performed genome sequencing for 20 unrelated P. aeruginosa isolates. These isolates represent the 15 most prominent clonal lineages of the worldwide P. aeruginosa population and 5 lineages which had not been found among clinical samples at the time of selection. Thus genome comparisons of these 20 isolates should allow a comprising view on the pangenome of this bacterial species characterized as an opportunistic pathogen with high metabolic versatility.	eSequencing	P. aeruginosa pangenome	eOther	eOther	eMonoisolate	The Pseudomonas aeruginosa pangenome							2014-04-15T00:00:00Z			MHH
743	244623	PRJDB1483	Genome sequencing and assembly	Quantum dots (QDs) are 1–10 nm semiconductor nanoparticles that possess size-dependent luminescence. One of the QDs, cadmium selenide (CdSe) attracts particular attention because it is useful for light emitting diodes, solar cells, and biological imaging. However, conventional chemical synthesis of CdSe involves highly toxic solvents and high temperatures. Additionally, it is not easy to obtain nanoparticles of the desired size because of their high growth rate. To overcome the shortcomings of the chemical synthesis method, microbial synthesis of CdSe at ambient temperature and pressure without toxic solvents has attracted much attention recently as an environmentally friendly procedure. Microbial manufacturing will increase controllability of the formation and growth of the QDs. To date, only a few microbes have been applied to CdSe synthesis. It is therefore worthwhile to seek novel, effective CdSe-synthesizing microbes, especially for use in the one-vessel process. However, no report in the relevant literature to date describes a study conducted to screen microbes suitable for one-vessel CdSe synthesis. Such bacteria might be capable of being both cadmium-resistant and of reducing selenite to selenide. The bacterium with both cadmium-resistant and selenite-reducing capabilities as a promising microbial catalyst for producing CdSe nanoparticles using an economical and environmentally friendly one-vessel process was enriched and isolated from a sample.	eSequencing	Pseudomonas aeruginosa RB strain:RB	eWhole	eGenome	eMonoisolate	Pseudomonas aeruginosa RB		RB	1407649	287	eBacteria	2013-10-02	2014-04-14T00:00:00Z			Osaka University

826	239877	PRJNA239877	Transcriptome or Gene expression	GAPDHs from human pathogens S. aureus and P. aeruginosa can be readily inhibited by ROS-mediated direct oxidation of their catalytic active cysteines. Because of the rapid degradation of H2O2 by bacterial catalase, only steady-state but not one-dose treatment of H2O2 induces rapid metabolic reroute from glycolysis to pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). We conducted RNA-seq analyses to globally profile the bacterial transcriptomes in response to a steady level of H2O2, which reveals profound transcriptional changes including the induced expression of glycolytic genes in both bacteria. Our results revealed that the inactivation of GAPDH by H2O2 induces a metabolic reroute from glycolysis to PPP; the elevated levels of fructose 1,6-biphosphate (FBP) and 2-keto-3-deoxy-6-phosphogluconate (KDPG) lead to dissociation of their corresponding glycolytic repressors (GapR and HexR, respectively) from their cognate promoters, thus resulting in derepression of the glycolytic genes to overcome H2O2-stalled glycolysis in S. aureus and P. aeruginosa, respectively. Given that H2O2 can be produced constitutively by the host immune response, exposure to the steady-state stress of H2O2 recapitulates more accurately bacterial responses to host immune system in vivo.

828	238880	PRJNA238880	Transcriptome or Gene expression	We analyzed the transcriptional profile of P.aeruginosa PA14 grown under 14 different environmental conditions. These included conditions of growth within biofilms, at various temperatures, osmolarities and phosphate concentrations, under anaerobic conditions, attached to a surface and conditions encountered within the eukaryotic host. We found that >30% of the PA14 genome was differentially regulated at least under one of the 14 environmental conditions (referred to as the adaptive transcriptome). Most of the genes were also differentially regulated upon sigma factor hyper expression and/or inactivation (GEO accession number GSE54999) and many of those belonged to primary alternative sigma factor regulons. Overall design: The samples of P. aeruginosa PA14 wild type strain were cultivated under 14 different experimental conditions and were analyzed by RNA-seq. For each condition, at least two biological replicates were generated Please note that PA14 is our standard lab strain used for all generated data in this records. There is no mutation introduced for any of those experiments, and thus, the descriptions only highlight the growth conditions.	eSequencing	Pseudomonas aeruginosa	eWhole	eTranscriptome	eMultiisolate	The P. aeruginosa PA14 transcriptome recorded under 14 different experimental conditions			287	287	eBacteria	2014-02-20		2019-07-24		Prof. Dieter Jahn, Institute of Microbiology, Technische Universität Braunschweig	ePublished;ePublished	2015-07-02T00:00:00Z;2018-05-09T00:00:00Z	26126853;29738307	ePubmed;ePubmed

In particular, alternative sigma factors are well-known to be key players of bacterial adaptation to changing environments. To elucidate the regulatory network of sigma factors in P. aeruginosa, an integrative approach including sigma factor-dependent mRNA profiling was performed to define the primary regulon of each sigma factor. Overall design: Sigma factor hyper-expressing strains harboring the sigma factor gene in trans under control of the araBAD promoter and sigma factor deletion mutants were constructed. Under optimal conditions regarding sigma factor activity and optional induction of sigma factor expression, bacteria were harvested and total RNA was extracted. Upon mRNA enrichment, RNA was fragmented and ligated to specific RNA-adapters containing a hexameric barcode sequence for multiplexing. These RNA-libraries were reverse transcribed and amplified resulting in cDNA libraries which were sequenced on Illumina platforms. Sequence reads were separated according to their barcodes and barcode sequences were removed. The short reads were mapped to the genome sequence of the reference strain P. aeruginosa PA14 wild-type using stampy with default settings. The R package DESeq was used for differential gene expression analysis.	eSequencing	Pseudomonas aeruginosa	eWhole	eTranscriptome	eMultiisolate	Analysis of sigma factor-dependent gene expression in Pseudomonas aeruginosa by RNA sequencing			287	287	eBacteria	2014-02-13		2019-07-24		Prof. Dieter Jahn, Institute of Microbiology, Technische Universität Braunschweig	ePublished;ePublished	2015-03-18T00:00:00Z;2018-05-09T00:00:00Z	25780925;29738307	ePubmed;ePubmed

In particular, alternative sigma factors are well-known to be key players of bacterial adaptation to changing environments. To elucidate the regulatory network of sigma factors in P. aeruginosa, an integrative approach including ChIP-seq of 11 polyhistidine-tag sigma factors was performed to define the primary regulon of each sigma factor. Overall design: Sigma factor genes were fused to a polyhistidine-tag and provided in trans. Under optimal conditions regarding sigma factor activity and induction of sigma factor expression, DNA-sigma factor interactions were conserved by formaldehyde treatment. Upon DNA fragmentation by sonication, the complexes were specifically immunoprecipitated by polyclonal anti-6X His-tag antibodies and the purified DNA was analyzed by Illumina sequencing. DNA enrichment to a control strain was calculated and used for peak calling within promoter region (-500,+100) to identify directly regulated genes/operons.	eSequencing	Pseudomonas aeruginosa	eWhole	eGenome	eMultiisolate	ChIP-seq study of sigma factors in Pseudomonas aeruginosa			287	287	eBacteria	2014-02-13		2019-07-24		Prof. Dieter Jahn, Institute of Microbiology, Technische Universität Braunschweig	ePublished;ePublished	2015-03-18T00:00:00Z;2018-05-09T00:00:00Z	25780925;29738307	ePubmed;ePubmed
832	238223	PRJNA238223	Transcriptome or Gene expression	Chronic Pseudomonas biofilm infections are commonly associated in patients afflicted with cystic fibrosis (CF) leading to high degree of morbidity. In a murine tumor model we demonstrated that P. aeruginosa efficiently colonizes and forms biofilms in cancerous tissue post intra-venous injection. Several non-biofilm forming mutants have been identified and incorporated in the present study. Biofilm formation by wild type strains was evident in electron microscopy and immuno-histological studies. Efficacy of currently available CF infection treatment antibiotics such as ciprofloxacin, colistin and tobramycin were tested in this model. We found out that normal doses of these antibiotics were unable to eliminate wild type P. aeruginosa PA14. However, transposon mutants of P. aeruginosa PA14 (pqsA & Pel A) had strong influence on colonization. Subsequently high doses were effective against wild type P. aeruginosa PA14 biofilms. Overall design: The samples of P. aeruginosa PA14 wild type strain and the transposon mutant of pqsA were analyzed by RNA-seq. The control samples were cultivated in the LB medium until the exponential or stationary growth phase. Four biological replicas were pooled in pairs to get two replicas for RNA extraction, library preparation and sequencing. Tumor samples were collected from mice infected with PA14 wild type or PA14 pqsA transposon mutants. There were four mice per group and the material of each group was pooled to assure sufficient bacterial RNA. The tumor samples were split into two technical replicas for sequencing library preparation.

840	236003	PRJEB4573	Other	A series of extensively drug-resistant (XDR) isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa from two outbreaks in UK hospitals were characterized by whole genome sequencing (WGS). Although these isolates were resistant to antibiotics other than colistin, we confirmed that they are still sensitive to disinfectants. The sequencing confirmed that isolates in the larger outbreak were serotype O12 and further revealed that they belonged to the ST111 sequence type which is a major epidemic strain of P. aeruginosa throughout Europe. As this is the first reported sequence of an ST111 strain, the genome was examined in depth, focusing particularly on antibiotic resistance and potential virulence genes, and on the reported regions of genome plasticity. High degrees of sequence similarity were discovered between outbreak isolates collected from recently infected patients, sinks, an isolate from the sewer and an historical isolate, suggesting that the ST111 strain has been endemic in the hospital for many years. The ability to translate easily from outbreak investigation to detailed genome biology using the same data demonstrates the flexibility of WGS application in a clinical setting.	eSequencing	Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA38182	eOther	eOther	eMonoisolate	Genome sequencing and characterization of an XDR ST111 serotype O12 hospital outbreak strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa		PA38182	1407059	287	eBacteria		2014-01-24T00:00:00Z			BUGS			24422878	ePubmed

869	231258	PRJEB4506	Other	Objective: As a result of the introduction of rapid benchtop sequencers, the time required to subculture a bacterial pathogen to extract sufficient DNA for library preparation can now exceed the time to sequence said DNA. We have eliminated this rate-limiting step by developing a protocol to generate DNA libraries for whole-genome sequencing directly from single bacterial colonies grown on primary culture plates. Methods: We developed our protocol using single colonies of 17 bacterial pathogens responsible for severe human infection that were grown using standard diagnostic media and incubation conditions. We then applied this method to four clinical scenarios that currently require time-consuming reference laboratory tests: full identification and genotyping of salmonellae; identification of the New Delhi metallo-β-lactamase, a highly transmissible carbapenem-resistance gene, in Klebsiella pneumoniae; detection of staphylococcal toxins associated with specific disease syndromes; and monitoring of vaccine targets to detect vaccine escape in Neisseria meningitidis. Results: We validated our single-colony whole-genome sequencing protocol for all 40 combinations of pathogen and selective, non-selective or indicator media tested in this study. Moreover, we demonstrated the clinical value of this method compared to current reference laboratory tests. Conclusion: This advance will facilitate the implementation of whole-genome sequencing into diagnostic and public health microbiology.	eSequencing	Rapid single-colony whole-genome sequencing of bacterial pathogens	eOther	eOther	eMonoisolate	The aim of this study was to develop a method to allow whole-genome sequencing of major bacterial pathogens directly from single colonies.							2013-12-11T00:00:00Z			CANTAB			24370932	ePubmed

871	231221	PRJNA231221	Genome sequencing and assembly	In May 2014, the FDA and collaborators established a publicly available dAtabase for Reference Grade micrObial Sequences called FDA-ARGOS. With funding support from FDA’s Office of Counterterrorism and Emerging Threats (OCET) and DoD, the FDA-ARGOS team are initially collecting and sequencing 2000 microbes that include biothreat microorganisms, common clinical pathogens and closely related species. Currently, FDA-ARGOS microbial genomes are generated in 3 phases. Generally: <ul> <li>Phase 1 entails collection of a previously identified microbe and nucleic acid extraction.</li> <li>Phase 2, the microbial nucleic acids are sequenced and de novo assembled using Illumina and PacBio sequencing platforms at the Institute for Genome Sciences at the University of Maryland (UMD-IGS).</li> <li>Phase 3, the assembled genomes are vetted by an ID-NGS subject matter expert working group consisting of FDA personnel and collaborators and the data are deposited in NCBI databases.</li> </ul> <p> The FDA-ARGOS genomes meet the quality metrics for reference-grade genomes for regulatory use. FDA-ARGOS reference genomes have been de novo assembled with high depth of base coverage and placed within a pre-established phylogenetic tree. Each microbial isolate in the database is covered at a minimum of 20X over 95 percent of the assembled core genome. Furthermore, sample specific metadata, raw reads, assemblies, annotation and details of the bioinformatics pipeline are available.	eSequencing		eWhole	eGenome	eMultispecies	FDA-ARGOS is a database with public quality-controlled reference genomes for diagnostic use and regulatory science;Enhancement of Microbial Sequence Quality for Regulatory and Clinical Decision Processes Using High Throughput Sequencing Technologies						2013-12-11		2013-12-11	yes	US Food and Drug Administration;University of Maryland School of Medicine Institute for Genome Sciences (IGS) - sequencing center	eUnpublished		31346170	ePubmed

1015	219396	PRJNA219396	Other	We analyzed a deletion mutant of the ECF σ factor SigX and applied mRNA profiling to define the SigX dependent regulon in P. aeruginosa in response to low osmolarity medium conditions. Furthermore, the combination of transcriptional data with chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) followed by high-throughput sequencing led to the identification of the DNA binding motif of SigX. Genome-wide mapping of SigX-binding regions revealed enrichment of downstream genes involved in fatty acid biosynthesis, type III secretion, swarming and c-di-GMP signaling. In accordance, a sigX deletion mutant exhibited an altered fatty acid composition of the cell membrane, reduced cytotoxicity, impaired swarming activity, elevated c-di-GMP levels and increased biofilm formation. In conclusion, a combination of ChIP-seq with transcriptional profiling and bioinformatic approaches to define consensus DNA binding sequences proved to be effective for the elucidation of the regulon of the alternative σ factor SigX revealing its role in complex virulence-associated phenotypes in P. aeruginosa.

1040	204640	PRJEB2936	Other	Strains belonging to the clonal lineage TB of Pseudomonas aeruginosa became prominent in the Hannover area in the 1980 years colonising the airways of several cystic fibrosis (CF) patients and impairing their clinical status significantly. Phenotypic analyses showed remarkable differences compared to other clonal lineages, but also among clone TB isolates itself, although genomic analyses had indicated a high degree of similarity. Intraclonal variations were also found in transcriptome and proteome profiles of the two CF airways isolates TBCF10839 and TBCF121838. Genome sequencing of these two strains and a clone TB wound isolate TB63741 from the same clinic was applied to unravel the deviations of this clonal lineage from other P. aeruginosas and also the intraclonal genomic deviations distinguishing these special isolates.	eSequencing		eWhole	eOther	eMonoisolate	Microevolution of Pseudomonas aeruginosa clone TB isolates from related geographic origin							2012-03-28T01:00:00Z			MHH

1042	204043	PRJEB2325	Other	The opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa frequently colonizes the airways of patients suffering from cystic fibrosis. Strains of this species often cause chronic infections and stayin the lungs for many years. During that time of adaption to the different niches in the lung, challenges by the host's immune system or antibiotics, confrontation with other colonizing P. aeruginosa strains or bacterial species etc. the strains undergo a microevolution in the lung habitat causing the rise of different variants or 'ecotypes' of the original colonizing strain. In order to identify the respective genomic changes we sequenced the genomic DNA of sets of three sequential isolates each from the airways of two CF patients. Over many years isolates had been obtained from these patients belonging to the same major clonal lineage within the species P. aeruginosa (clone PA14 for one patient, clone C for the other), indicating that the subsequent isolates indeed represent such variants arisen from the original colonizer by microevolution. Each set of isolates (RN3, RN6, RN43, and NN2, NN11, NN80, respectively) comprises a so-called early isolate (first isolate of the persisting clonal lineage), a middle isolate (obtained 16 ? 22 month after the early isolate and a late isolate from more than 12 years later. Thus the screening for genomic differences between these isolates allows monitoring the bacterial microevolution in a cystic fibrosis lung habitat for two different cases over a long time course.	eSequencing	Sequential_isolates_clones_PA14_and_C	eWhole	eOther	eMonoisolate	Microevolution of the two most abundant Pseudomonas aeruginosa clones PA14 and C in cystic fibrosis lungs							2011-09-30T00:00:00Z			MHH			20023018	ePubmed
1043	203784	PRJEB2055	Other	Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 is the most commonly used strain for research on this ubiquitous and metabolically versatile opportunistic pathogen. Strain PAO1, a derivative of the original Australian PAO isolate, has been distributed worldwide to laboratories and strain collections. Over decades discordant phenotypes of PAO1 sublines have emerged. Taking the existing PAO1-UW genome sequence (named after the University of Washington, which led the sequencing project) as a blueprint, the genome sequences of reference strains MPAO1 and PAO1-DSM (stored at the German Collection for Microorganisms and Cell Cultures [DSMZ]) were resolved by physical mapping and deep short read sequencing-by-synthesis. MPAO1 has been the source of near-saturation libraries of transposon insertion mutants, and PAO1-DSM is identical in its SpeI-DpnI restriction map with the original isolate. The major genomic differences of MPAO1 and PAO1-DSM in comparison to PAO1-UW are the lack of a large inversion, a duplication of a mobile 12-kb prophage region carrying a distinct integrase and protein phosphatases or kinases, deletions of 3 to 1,006 bp in size, and at least 39 single-nucleotide substitutions, 17 of which affect protein sequences. The PAO1 sublines differed in their ability to cope with nutrient limitation and their virulence in an acute murine airway infection model. Subline PAO1-DSM outnumbered the two other sublines in late stationary growth phase. In conclusion, P. aeruginosa PAO1 shows an ongoing microevolution of genotype and phenotype that jeopardizes the reproducibility of research. High-throughput genome resequencing will resolve more cases and could become a proper quality control for strain collections.	eSequencing	PAO_DSM_1707	eOther	eOther	eMonoisolate	Genome Diversity of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 Laboratory Strains							2010-03-18T00:00:00Z			MHH			20023018	ePubmed

1053	190894	PRJNA190894	Transcriptome or Gene expression	The ParS/ParR two component regulatory system plays important roles for multidrug resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In this study we report RNA-seq analyses of the transcriptomes of P. aeruginosa PAO1 wild type and par mutants growing in a minimal medium containing 2% casamino acids. This has allowed the quantification of PAO1 transcriptome, and further defines the regulon that is dependent on the ParS/ParR system for expression. Our RNA-seq analysis produced the first estimates of absolute transcript abundance for the 5570 coding genes in P. aeruginosa PAO1. Comparative transcriptomics of P. aeruginosa PAO1 and par mutants identified a total of 464 genes regulated by ParS and ParR. Results also showed that mutations in the parS/parR system abolished the expression of the mexEF-oprN operon by down-regulating the regulatory gene mexS. In addition to affecting drug resistance genes, transcripts of quorum sensing genes (rhlIR and pqsABCDE-phnAB), were significantly up-regulated in both parS and parR mutants. Consistent with these results, a significant portion of the ParS/ParR regulated genes belonged to the MexEF-OprN and quorum sensing regulons. Deletion of par genes also lead to overproduction of phenazines and increased swarming motility, consistent with the up-regulation of quorum sensing genes. Our results established a link among ParS/ParR, MexEF-OprN and quorum sensing in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Based on these results, we propose a model to illustrate the relationship among these regulatory systems in P. aeruginosa. Overall design: A total of 9 samples were analyzed in AB medium + 2% casamino acids, Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 wild type strain (3 replicates); Pseudomonas aeruginosa parS mutant (3 replicates); Pseudomonas aeruginosa parR mutant (3 replicates).	eSequencing	Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1	eWhole	eTranscriptome	eMultiisolate	The ParS/ParR regulon in Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1			208964	287	eBacteria	2013-02-26		2016-02-26		TAMU

1078	153301	PRJNA153301	Transcriptome or Gene expression	Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a highly adaptable bacterium which thrives in a broad range of ecological niches and can infect multiple hosts as diverse as plants, nematodes and mammals. In humans, it is an important opportunistic pathogen. This wide adaptability correlates with its broad genetic diversity. In this study, we used a deep-sequencing approach to explore the complement of small RNAs (sRNAs) in P. aeruginosa as the number of such regulatory molecules previously identified in this organism is relatively low, considering its genome size, phenotypic diversity and adaptability. We have performed a comparative analysis of PAO1 and PA14 strains which share the same host range but differ in pathogenicity, PA14 being considerably more virulent in several model organisms. Altogether, we have identified more than 150 novel candidate sRNAs and validated a third of them by Northern blotting. Interestingly, a number of these novel sRNAs are strain-specific or showed strain-specific expression, strongly suggesting that they could be involved in determining specific phenotypic traits. Overall design: 2 cDNA samples (enriched for different size ranges ) from each of two strains of Pseudomonas aeruginoasa (PAO1 and PA14) were sequenced with the Roche 454 technology	eSequencing	Pseudomonas aeruginosa	eWhole	eTranscriptome	eMultiisolate	Comparative Profiling of Pseudomonas aeruginosa Strains Reveals Differential Expression of Novel Unique and Conserved Small RNAs			287	287	eBacteria	2012-03-07	2012-06-04T00:00:00Z	2019-05-15		Bioinformatics, Evolution and Comparative Genomics, Molecular Biosciences and Biotechnology, Università degli Studi di Milano	ePublished	2012-05-17T00:00:00Z	22590564	ePubmed

Furthermore, while most CF strains are genotypically different from person to person, some clones are found in a large proportion of CF patients, indicating they are probably transmissible and are often more virulent. Such clones include the Australian Epidemic Strain-1 (AES-1) which infects 10-40% of patients attending CF clinics in eastern Australia. AES-1R is an acute infection isolate of AES-1 and as such its genome represents the initial infective phase of AES-1 which will likely yield vital information on the genetic characteristics of this epidemic strain.	eSequencing	Pseudomonas aeruginosa AES-1R	eWhole	eGenome	eMonoisolate	Pseudomonas aeruginosa AES-1R Genome sequencing project		AES-1R	1000561	287	eBacteria	2011-03-22	2011-07-06T00:00:00Z			Bacterial Pathogens in CF group, Sydney Medical School, The University of Sydney Sydney Australia 2006;J.
